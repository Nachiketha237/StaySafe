CHAPTER ONE WHAT IS DISASTER
Learning objectives
At the end of the chapter the students are expected to:
 Define disaster, hazard, vulnerability and risk
 Describe the types and the causes of disasters.
 Discuss the magnitude and distribution of disasters  Explain different phases of disasters
1.1. Introduction:
Disasters and emergencies are fundamental reflections of normal life. They are consequences of the way society structure themselves, economically and socially; the way societies and states interact; and the way that relationships between the decision makers are sustained. The disaster emanates from the fact that certain communities or groups are forced to settle in areas susceptible to the impact of ranging river or a volcanic eruption. The magnitude of each disaster, be in terms of deaths, property damage or costs for a given developing country increases with the increment of marginalization of the population. As the population increases, the best land in both rural and urban areas is taken up, and those seeking land for farming or housing are forced to accept inadequate
1

land. These offer less productivity and a smaller measure of physical or economic safety.
Disasters have massive human and economic costs. They may cause many deaths, severe injuries, and food shortages. Most incidents of severe injuries and deaths occur during the time of impact, whereas disease outbreaks and food shortages often arise much later, depending on the nature and duration of the disaster. Anticipating the potential consequences of disasters can help determine the actions that need to be started before the disaster strikes to minimize its effects. This Chapter deals with definitions of disaster and other related terms like hazard, vulnerability and prevention. Moreover it also addresses types of disaster and discusses the trends of the occurrence of disasters to introduce readers the basic concepts of the subject matter.
1.2. Definitions:
Disaster: several definitions are frequently given to disaster. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a disaster as “a sudden ecological phenomenon of sufficient magnitude to require external assistance”. It is also defined as any event, typically occurring suddenly, that causes damage, ecological disruption, loss of human life, deterioration of health and health services, and which exceeds the capacity of the affected community on a scale sufficient to require outside assistance (Landsman, 2001). It is an emergency of such severity and magnitude that the resultant combination of
2

deaths, injuries, illness, and property damage cannot be effectively managed with routine procedures or resources.
Disaster is further defined as an event in which a society or a community undergoes acute deprivation of food and other basic necessities due to natural and man made calamities to such an extent that the normal function of the society or the community is disrupted and that it cannot subsist without outside intervention (13).
Emergency is a state in which normal procedures are suspended and extra-ordinary measures are taken in order to avert a disaster. An emergency can be defined in the context of the social, political and epidemiological circumstances in which it occurs.
Hazard is a rare or extreme event in the natural or human made environment that adversely affects human life, property or activity to the extent of causing a disaster. It is essential to make a distinction between hazards and disasters, and to recognize that the effect of the former upon the latter is essentially a measure of the society’s vulnerability.
(12)
Mitigation: is permanent reduction of the risk of a disaster. Primary mitigation refers to reducing the resistance of the hazard and reducing vulnerability. Secondary mitigation refers to reducing the effects of the hazard (preparedness).
Mitigation includes recognizing that disasters will occur; attempts are made to reduce the harmful effects of a disaster, and to limit their impact on human suffering and economic assets.
3

Prevention is defined as those activities taken to prevent a natural phenomenon or potential hazard from having harmful effects on either people or economic assets. Delayed actions drain the economy and the resources for emergency response within a region. For developing nations, prevention is perhaps the most critical components in managing disasters, however, it is clearly one of the most difficult to promote. Prevention planning is based on two issues: hazard identification (identifying the actual threats facing a community) and vulnerability assessment (evaluating the risk and capacity of a community to handle the consequences of the disaster). Once these issues put in order of priority, emergency managers can determine the appropriate prevention strategies.
Disaster prevention refers to measures taken to eliminate the root- causes that make people vulnerable to disaster (13).
Preparedness: Are the measures that ensure the organized mobilization of personnel, funds, equipments, and supplies within a safe environment for effective relief.
Disaster preparedness is building up of capacities before a disaster situation prevails inorder to reduce impacts. Its measures include inter alia, availability of food reserve, emergency reserve fund, seed reserve, health facilities, warning systems, logistical infrastructure, relief manual, and shelves of projects (13).
Reconstruction: the full resumption of socio-economic activities plus preventive measures.
Rehabilitation: is the restoration of basic social functions. 4

Resilience: is adaptability, capacity to recover.
Response: is the set of activities implemented after the impact of a disaster in order to assess the needs, reduce the suffering, limit the spread and the consequences of the disaster, open the way to rehabilitation.
Risk is the expected losses (lives lost, persons injured, damages to property and disruption of economic activity) due to a particular hazard. Risk is the product of hazard and vulnerability.
Risk is the probability that a person will experience an event in a specified period of time. Risk as a function of hazard and vulnerability, a relationship that is frequently illustrated with the following formula, although the association is not strictly arthematic:
Risk = hazard x vulnerability.
Risk is the probability of being affected by the unwanted consequences of a hazard. It combines the level of hazard and degree of vulnerability.
Risk assessment is a term used widely for a systematic approach to characterizing the risks posed to individuals and populations by potentially adverse exposures.
Susceptibility: is exposure to danger.
Vulnerability: is the degree of loss resulting from a potentially damaging phenomenon.
5

It is the susceptibility of a population to specific type of event. Vulnerability is also associated with the degree of possible or potential loss from a risk that results from a hazard at a given intensity. The factors that influence intensity include demographics, the age, and resilience of the environment, technology, social differentiation and diversity as well as regional and global economics and politics.
It is essential to make distinction between hazard and disaster. The presence of hazard by its self can neither cause risk nor disasters. There are different predisposing factors that make vulnerable the survivors. The following are some of such underlying causes:
Poverty: Virtually all disaster studies show that the wealthiest of the population survive the disaster, remains unaffected or are able to recover quickly.
 Population growth: Increasing number of people will compete for limited amount of resources which can lead to conflict and conflict may result in crisis-induced migration.
 Rapid urbanization: competition for scarce resources is an inevitable consequence of rapid urbanization, leading to human-made disasters.
 Transitions in cultural practices: Societies are constantly changing and in continuous state of transition. These transitions are often extremely disruptive and uneven, leaving gaps in social coping mechanisms and technology. Conflicts as well as transitional cultural practices can also
6

lead to civil conflict (e.g. communal violence triggered by
religious differences).
Environmental degradation: Deforestation leads to rapid rain
run off, which contributes to flooding.
Lack of awareness and information: Disasters can also
happen because people vulnerable to them simply do not know how to get out of harm’s way or to take protective measures.
Wars and civil strife are among the principal man made factors precipitating disaster.
Disaster mainly occurs when vulnerability and hazard meet. The interaction and association of such phenomena is depicted in the following figure (Figure 1).

1.3. TYPES OF DISASTERS
Disasters are broadly divided into two types comprising natural and man made (technological) disasters. There is also other basis by which disasters can be categorized which has been mentioned later in this section.
1.3.1. Natural disasters
Natural disasters occur as the result of action of the natural forces and tend to be accepted as unfortunate, but inevitable. The
8

natural disasters result from forces of climate and geology. Natural disasters are perhaps the most “unexpected” and costly overall in terms of loss of human lives and resources. In the last few years, natural disasters have claimed 100,000 lives costing above 140 billion US dollars.
During the 1980s, more than 700,000 people lost their lives as a direct result of severe weather, including floods and droughts. Natural disasters can be categorized as “acute” or “slow” in their onset. They should be predictable in certain instances since they cluster in geographical areas. Natural disasters with acute onsets include events such as earthquake, flood, hurricane, cyclone or typhoon, tornado, fire, tsunami or storm surge, avalanche, volcanic eruption, extreme cold or blizzard, and heat wave. Natural hazards with slow or gradual onset include drought, famine, desertification, deforestation, and pest infestation.
The 1990s and beyond proved to be even more calamitous, as global natural disaster trends rose with increasing rapidity (Figure 2). Among the different types of natural disasters, floods, tropical storms, droughts and earth-quakes are the most destructive, followed by landslides and storms.

Figure 2: Global trends of natural disasters.
In 1992 alone, natural disasters costed the world economy more money than it spent on development aid. The November 2004 typhoons in the Philippines also claimed over 1,000 lives and devastated the livelihoods of many more. The recent Indian Ocean Tsunami was even more destructive that more than 150,000 lives were lost. As reported by the secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), the last ten years have seen 478,100 people killed, more than 2.5 billion people affected and about US$ 690 billion in economic losses. Disasters triggered by hydro- meteorological hazards amounted for 97 percent of the total people affected by disasters, and 60 percent of the total economic losses (30).The damage and costs inflicted by natural disasters spread well
10
 
beyond the immediate regions affected, to countries as a whole and often to the wider global community.
The incidence of hazards demonstrates considerable geographic variation. During the period 1994-2003, Asia was disproportionately affected by natural disasters (Figure 3). Approximately half of the 650 natural catastrophes recorded in 2004 were windstorms and severe weather events, while 80 were due to geological hazards (70 damaging earthquakes and 10 volcanic eruptions). As a result of increasingly effective preventive measures, while the number of disasters has more than tripled since the 1970s, the reported death toll has almost been reduced by half.
11

Figure 3: Distribution of natural disasters by Region
Around 75 percent of the world’s population lives in areas affected at least once by earthquake, tropical cyclone, flood or drought between 1980 and 2000. Billions of people in more than 100 countries are periodically exposed to at least one event of earthquake, tropical cyclone, flood or drought. As a result of disasters triggered by these natural hazards, more than 184 deaths per day are recorded in different parts of the world, 11 percent of the people exposed to natural hazards live in countries classified as having low human
12
 
development, and they account for more than 53 percent of total recorded deaths7. For each hazard type, disaster risk is considerably lower in high-income countries than in medium- and low-income countries.
Figure 4: Economic losses due to natural disasters 1960-2000 (million US$)
Natural disasters can have significant economic and food security impacts, especially on the poorest households. In the last three decades, there has been a clear increase in the number of natural hazard events, the size of affected populations and the extent of economic losses (Figure 4). Several million victims have suffered
13
  
homelessness, disaster induced ill health, severe economic losses and personal tragedies.
Direct economic losses increased five times in the 1990s (Figure 4) and are mostly concentrated in the developed countries. Underlying these economic figures is not only the destruction of productive assets and vital infrastructure and the loss of livelihood systems but also their implication to economic development and poverty aggravation. When disasters occur, poor households suffer greater relative losses in terms of physical and social assets, resulting in deepening their poverty further. Such losses of assets can trap households in chronic poverty and food insecurity.
An important development in disaster management approaches over the past decade has been the recognition of their cyclical nature. Although the response phase captures most of the attention, much of the hard work on disaster risk management is carried out before disasters occur, in the form of risk assessment, prevention, mitigation, and establishing early warning systems. After the crisis has passed, the emphasis is on rehabilitation, reconstruction, and the commencement of a new cycle of assessment, incorporating lessons derived from the previous cycle.
1.3.2. Human (technological) causes
The technological or manmade disasters result from some human activities, such as explosions, fires, the release of toxic chemicals or radioactive materials, bridge or building collapse, crashes, dam or levee failure, nuclear reactor accidents, breaks in water, gas, or
14

sewer lines, deforestation, war, etc. Technological disasters tend to involve many more casualties than natural disasters of the same magnitude of energy release.
Technological or man-made disasters are unpredictable, can spread across geographical areas, may be unpreventable and may have limited physical damage but long-term effect. They are also much more difficult for the community to deal with and for victims to accept. In technological disasters, there are issues of blame involved and the community spends much time discussing who was responsible and what mistakes were made. Increasingly, agencies involved in disasters and their management are concerned with the interactions between man and nature, which can be complex and can aggravate disasters.
Communities in which industrial sites are located or through which hazardous material pass via high way, rail, or pipeline are at risk for technological disasters. Injuries can occur to workers at the site, to responders bringing the incident under control and providing emergency medical care, and to residents in the community. Those with pre-existing medical conditions, such as lung or heart diseases, could be at increased risk for negative health outcomes if exposed to toxic related skin disorders, and lung damage can result from exposure to specific agents.
Ensuring that local industry implements basic safety procedures can significantly reduce negative health outcome from accidental release of toxins. Emergency preparedness – including the ability of pre-
15

hospital and hospital systems to care for patients exposed to industrial agents, the training of medical personnel to work in contaminated environments, and the stockpiling of personal protective equipment for responders – is key for providing care following industrial accidents.
Another classification of disasters will be as follows:
1. Sudden-onset disasters include floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, or tidal waves, tropical storms, volcanic eruptions, and landslides. As their name implies, sudden-onset disasters occur swiftly and often without any warning. Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster associated with sudden migration of large populations and food shortages. Other types of disasters generally occur more frequently in Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean rather than in Africa. When these disasters occur, they frequently cause thousands of deaths and casualties. Earthquakes cause the greatest number of deaths and overwhelming infrastructural damage. Communities at risk of these types of disasters should recognize and respond to threats posed by local weather patterns and the shape and contours of the land.
2. Slow-onset disasters include droughts, famine, environmental degradation, deforestation (loss of trees and vegetation), pest infestation and desertification (conversion of arable lands to deserts). These disasters are usually the result of adverse weather conditions combined with poor land use. Traditionally, African communities, particularly the poor, have been at increased risk of
16

these types of disasters because of poverty and social inequality, environmental degradation from poor land use and rapid population growth. Slow-onset disasters can be prevented because they happen over a long period of time and human decisions contribute to (or cause) problems. Early warning systems can be easily put in place to lessen or even prevent the disaster.
3. Industrial/technological disasters result from a society’s industrial and technological activities that lead to pollution, spillage, explosions, and fires. They may occur because of poor planning and construction of manmade facilities (buildings, factories, etc.) or from neglect of safety procedures. Sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and terrorist acts may trigger secondary disasters such as fires or pollution. Industrial events have the potential to cause large-scale loss of life and infrastructural damage, especially in developing countries with unregulated industrialization, and inadequate safety standards and disaster response capacity. Wherever there is a man-made facility, there is the potential for an industrial or technological disaster to occur. Reducing the occurrence and effects of industrial disasters requires a multi- sectoral approach.
4. Complex emergencies are usually man-made, with multiple contributing factors. They often follow wars between states, internal conflict, and, increasingly, terrorist acts. Massive population displacements may occur due to lack of food, insecurity, and increasing death rates. Poverty and risk of conflict go hand in hand. Civilians that are not part of the conflicts end up bearing the majority
17

of casualties because they are often targets of both sides of the conflict.
5. Epidemic diseases are those diseases that normally do not occur in stable communities but have the potential to spread under certain conditions. This can cause frequent and severe outbreaks. These diseases may be spread by contaminated water or food, person-to-person contact, or through animals or insect vectors. Examples of epidemic diseases that commonly threaten displaced populations include cholera, measles, dysentery, respiratory infections, malaria, and, increasingly, HIV. After a major disaster, the risk of epidemic diseases increases mainly as a result of overcrowding and unhygienic conditions
1.4. Phases of Disasters:
Disaster situations are dynamic, always changing and demanding a change in response. Disasters can be viewed as a series of phases on a time continuum. Even though the evolving situation may appear continuous, identifying and understanding these phases helps to describe related needs and to conceptualize appropriate disaster management activities. These phases are described below:
1. Pre-emergency phase: the period before the disaster strikes may be used to assess how often a particular community is exposed to different risks (risk mapping) and how good is their preparedness. Protective actions can be undertaken based on the disaster warning and the available resources, e.g. identifying temporary shelters,
18

stocking basic supplies, planning evacuation routes, monitoring trends, etc.
2. Impact and flight phase: when a disaster strikes the hazard (fire, earthquake, floods, conflicts, etc) may trigger the displacement of large number of people from their homes. How long this phase lasts depends on the type of disaster, the number people affected and the distance they must travel to find sanctuary. Search and rescue and other assistances, e.g. providing transportation, shelter and basic supplies to affected people may be carried out to reduce the loss of lives.
3. Acute phase: this phase begins immediately after the impact of the disaster and marked by intense, often reactive activities by many humanitarian agencies responding to media reports of very high death rate (may be 5-60 times the normal death rate). The priority is to keep the affected people alive. Security may be a major concern in complex emergency situations. Critical services such as providing food, water, sanitation, basic health care, protection from violence and harassment are to be quickly organized. This phase ends when crude death rate falls below 1/10,000 persons per day (the crude mortality rate for stable population in Africa is about 0.5/10,000 individual per day).
4. Post emergency phase: the population movement usually slows down. This enables critical services to be properly established and maintained. During this phase the cause of displacement may be evolving. The displaced people wait for “something to happen” so
19

that they can return home, integrate with the local community or relocate else where. As international support declines, the emphasis shifts to building local capacity of and promoting community participation. Tracing reproductive health care, mental health care and other services may be initiated, based on the epidemiological information. It is difficult to set time limits on the post-disaster time phases or to accurately define the limits of each, even for one specific type of disaster. For example, the emergency phase of a hurricane or a flood may be only a few days, or as long as a week. A drought and a resulting famine can last for months or even a year or more.
5. Repatriation phase: after the emergency situation is over, displaced people are expected to return to their place of origin either on their own or with the help of relief agencies. Repatriation may be either forced or voluntary.
6. Rehabilitation or reconstruction phase: once permanent solution is obtained, the focus shifts from relief to development. The aim is to help the affected community become self-reliant. The responsibility of providing assistance is handed over to the affected community, the local authorities, development agencies and other non-governmental organizations. Because humanitarian and development technicians have different approaches to providing assistance and the infrastructure for relief is inadequate for development, the programs are re-oriented and redesigned.

2.1 Introduction
There are numerous factors that trigger the occurrence of disasters ranging from natural to man made predisposing factors. It is beyond the scope of this lecture note to discuss all. Hence this chapter deals with some prominent factors that lead to disasters. This chapter is organized in such away that it imparts readers the magnitudes, impacts and, where possible, the management (prevention and control) of these disaster causing factors.
22

2.2. Deforestation
Definition: Deforestation is the removal or damage of vegetation in a forest to the extent that it no longer supports its natural flora and fauna. It is most frequently caused by humans taking care of their immediate needs, while not being aware of the long-term effects of their actions.
Magnitude: The rapid rate of deforestation in the tropics is a key driving force in the yearly increase of flood disasters. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization and United Nations Environmental Program (FAO/UNEP) study in 1981, tropical forests are disappearing at the rate of 7.3 million hectares (18 million acres) per year:
• 4.2 million hectares (10.4 million acres) a year in Latin America
• 1.8 million hectares (4.4 million acres) a year in Asia
• 1.3 million hectares (3.2 million acres) a year in Africa.
Impacts
The greatest and most immediate danger of deforestation is that gradually diminishing forested areas contribute to or worsen other disasters. For example, by removing vegetation that retains water, deforestation can lead to flooding, drought and desertification. By removing vegetation that stabilizes the soil, desertification can lead to erosion, siltation and an increased chance of landslides during
23

earthquakes.
Impact on Agriculture and Ecology
Deforestation's impact on food supply follows this chain of events:
1. Deforestation
2. Erosion
3. Collapse of hillsides
4. Loss of topsoil and agricultural land.
5. Reduced productivity which leads to food insecurity.
Impact on Economy
What are the economic consequences of uncontrolled deforestation and forest-product scarcity?
• Rising dependence on imported forest products. Already most of the Third World countries are net importers of forest products, particularly paper.
• Foreign exchange shortages and high prices can hold a nation's wood and paper consumption well below the levels at which basic needs are satisfied.
• Acute scarcities of firewood and timber plague wide areas of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
• Soaring firewood prices are also another inflation source. In parts of West Africa and Central America, urban families spend one-fourth of their income on wood or charcoal for cooking.
24

Deforestation and timber scarcity have an especially harmful impact on housing in poor countries. Even if Third World governments were to make a serious effort to meet the housing problem, adequate wood supplies would not be available in many cases. For example, in the late 1970s, the Indian state of Gujarat conceived of an ambitious plan to construct huts for landless laborers. The plan was derailed by the lack of raw materials. The program called for 25 million wood poles, but only 400,000 of those became available each year; and only four million bamboo stalks were produced a year, although 765 million were needed.
Management
But essential as they are, forestry measures alone will not be enough to solve the deforestation problem. Many of the underlying sources of deforestation originate outside the scope of forestry per se. In order to halt the destructive spread of cultivation, national development patterns must provide the destroyers with alternative ways to feed themselves; in particular, crop yields and employment must be boosted on the lands best suited to farming. Sound forestry policies can contribute to these efforts, but broader decisions on investment priorities, land tenure, and the choice of technologies will be even more critical. Woodland depletion by firewood gatherers can be greatly mitigated by tree planting, but broader attention to rural energy needs, alternative energy sources, and national energy priorities is also necessary. Of course, human population growth underlies all the sources of deforestation. A vast amount of tree planting is essential over the
25

coming decades, but its benefits will be undercut if the deeper roots of deforestation are not eradicated. Deforestation also unbalances the water supply by contributing to drought and flood.
2.3. Drought and famine
Drought is defined as a water shortage caused by deficiency of
rainfall and differs from other natural hazards in three ways:
Drought is lack or insufficiency of rain for an extended period that severely disturbs the hydrologic cycle in an area. Droughts involve water shortages, crop damage, stream flow reduction, and depletion of groundwater and soil moisture. They occur when evaporation and transpiration exceed precipitation for a considerable period. Drought is the most serious hazard to agriculture in nearly every part of the world. Efforts have been made to control it by seeding clouds to induce rainfall, but these experiments have had only limited success.
A famine is a phenomenon in which a large percentage of the populations of a region or country are so undernourished and that death by starvation becomes increasingly common. In spite of the much greater technological and economic resources of the modern world, famine still strikes many parts of the world, mostly in the developing nations. Famine is associated with naturally-occurring crop failure and pestilence and artificially with war and genocide
• Drought has long been recognized as one of the most insidious causes of human misery.
26

• It has today the unfortunate distinction of being the natural disaster that annually claims most victims.
• Its ability to cause widespread misery is actually increasing.
While generally associated with semiarid climates, drought can occur in areas that normally enjoy adequate rainfall and moisture levels. In the broadest sense, any lack of water for the normal needs of agriculture, livestock, industry, or human population may be termed a drought. The cause may be lack of supply, contamination of supply, inadequate storage or conveyance facilities, or abnormal demand. Drought is usually accompanied by hot, dry winds and may be followed by damaging floods.
Geographical Distribution
Droughts occur in all of the world's continents. In recent decades, the most severe and devastating to human populations have been in Africa, perhaps giving the impression that droughts are principally an African problem. In fact, devastating droughts have occurred in virtually all of the major semiarid regions of the world as well as in many zones that are normally temperate climates with significant annual rainfalls.
In addition to the droughts in the African Sahel, there have recently been major droughts in northeast Brazil, Chile, Ethiopia, the Philippines, the Bolivian altiplano, and India. Near-drought conditions in the grain-producing regions of the United States and
27

the Soviet Union have also occurred, affecting greatly the international food supply and demand.
Trends in the occurrence of droughts indicate that they are becoming more frequent on the edges of desert lands and where agricultural, lumbering, and livestock grazing practices are changing.
Natural Preconditions for Drought Disasters
Drought differs from other natural disasters in its slowness of onset and its commonly lengthy duration. Before the rise of modern water- consuming cities, drought was an agricultural disaster. Now, with cities having expanded faster than water supplies can be made available, the specter of drought faces both the farmer and the urban dweller. Shifts in atmospheric circulation, which cause drought, may extend for time scales of a month, a season, several years or even a century. The following are conditions that lead to drought:
• Widespread and persistent atmospheric calm areas known as subsidence, which do not cause precipitation. These areas result from the present-day atmospheric circulation, which tends to create subsidence in the subtropical latitudes of both hemispheres.
• Localized subsidence induced by mountain barriers or other physiographic features. Most such areas lie in the lee of mountains across the westerly belts. They are hence in midlatitudes. The dryness is caused by the warming of
28

westerly currents as they descend east of the summits. This
allows them to hold moisture and carry it away.
• Absence of rainmaking disturbances causes dry weather even in areas of moist air. In general, rain is caused by the travel of organized disturbances across a region--i.e., systems that involve actual uplift of humid air. There is
plenty of water in the air, but nothing to bring it down as rain.
• Absence of humid airstreams. The relationship between the water available for precipitation (precipitable water) and
the precipitation that actually falls is by no means simple.
The above four predisposing factors are interdependent, but their relative effect depends on season and locality. One can broadly distinguish between:
1. Almost continuously dry climates, leading to desert surface conditions, in which there is no season of appreciable rainfall;
2. Semiarid or sub-humid climates with a short wet season in which humid airstreams or rainmaking disturbances penetrate;
3. The rare sub-humid areas in which rainfall is infrequent but not confined to a special season.
Human activities also contribute to the development of drought conditions. Overgrazing, poor cropping methods and improper soil conservation techniques often contribute to creating drought.
29

Recurrence Interval
Climatologists debate whether drought is a short-term aberration in the climate or the result of long-term climatic changes. Some argue that drought feeds upon itself; that as vegetation is stripped from the land; the surface dries out and reflects more of the sun's heat. This would alter the thermal dynamics of the atmosphere and suppress rainfall, which would, in turn, dry out more land.
Historically, droughts have tended to occur at regular intervals. Whether precisely predictable or not, the historical trends can give an indication as to when drought periods might be expected. For this reason, it is important that persons living in marginal or semiarid areas try to learn about the history of drought in that particular region and use this knowledge as a rule of thumb in predicting future drought periods.
Impact of Droughts on Built and Natural Environments Primary (Immediate) Effects
• Water supplies are overtaxed and finally dry up
• Loss of crops
• Loss of livestock and other animals, and
• Loss of water for hygienic use and drinking.
Secondary (Resulting) Effects of Drought
• Migration in search of better grazing lands 30

• Famine
• Permanent changes of settlement, social, and living
patterns.
• Major ecological changes (scrub growth, flash flooding and
increased wind erosion of soils)
• Desertification.
The Impact of Droughts on Development
If a drought is allowed to continue without response, the impact on development can be severe. Food shortages may become chronic. The country urban growth may be accelerated due to migration of people from rural areas. To respond to this, the government must borrow heavily and must divert money from other development schemes in order to meet these needs. All serve to undermine the potential for economic development.
If drought response is treated as only a relief operation, it may wipe out years of development work, especially in rural areas. Agricultural projects in particular are most likely to be affected by droughts. A balanced agricultural program that develops good water resources, addresses the problems of soil erosion, adopts realistic limits on the expansion of animal herds, or accompanies herd expansion with comprehensive range management will contribute to the mitigation of drought impact.
31

The same philosophy is used for reconstruction in the aftermath of a drought. Reconstruction should be viewed as an opportunity to accelerate development work. It is an ideal time to introduce improved animal husbandry techniques, rangeland management, water resource development schemes and erosion control measures.
Relief Operations for Famine and Food Emergencies
The primary purpose of relief operations during famine is to provide food to inhibit the occurrence of malnutrition. The nutrition component of relief operations in times of famine and food emergency may be divided into two broad groups of interrelated activities dealing with general food rations and selective feeding programs. Often the provision of food assistance to disaster victims is accompanied by public health programs, particularly immunization campaigns and primary health care services.
General food rations: involves the complex interaction of nutritional planning, agency appeal and procurement, donor pledging, international shipping, national logistics, warehousing, inventory and distribution.
Selective feeding programs: The purposes of selective feeding programs are to provide complete protection to population groups with increased vulnerability to nutritional deficiencies and to recuperate those already suffering from malnutrition. Selective feeding programs for disaster victims are usually divided

into two distinct operations. Supplementary feeding programs are designed to protect vulnerable groups against malnutrition and to rehabilitate those individuals currently suffering from moderate protein-energy malnutrition (PEM).
Intensive feeding programs (also called therapeutic feeding) are curative operations designed to reduce mortality among cases of severe PEM.

Public health interventions
 Monitor health and nutritional status by assessing using anthropometric measurements;
 Monitor death rate;
 Ensure safe water, sanitation, and disease control.
 Assess and ensure food safety and security, including
availability, accessibility, and consumption pattern;
2.4. Epidemic Definition:
An epidemic is the occurrence of a number of cases of a disease in excess of the usual occurrence for a given place and time.
A threatened (or potential) epidemic is said to exist when the circumstances are such that the epidemic occurrence of a specific disease may reasonably be anticipated.
The spread of infectious disease depends upon preexisting levels of the disease, ecological changes resulting from disaster, population displacement, and changes in the density of population, disruption of public utilities, interruption of basic public health services, compromising the sanitation and hygiene. The probability that epidemics of infectious diseases will occur is proportional to the population density and displacement. An epidemic can occur in susceptible populations in the presence or impeding introduction of a disease agent compounded by the presence of a mechanism that facilitates large-scale transmission (For example, Contamination of water supply or increment of vector population).
35

In general, many natural and/or man made disasters that affect or disrupt one or more parts of the public health infrastructure, including the sanitation systems, potable water supplies, nutrition stores, primary health care access (including routine immunization program), vector control programs, and established systematic surveillance mechanisms, can trigger infectious disease outbreaks.
Impact:
Displaced populations suffer high rate of disease due to stress of migration, crowding, and unsanitary conditions of relocation sites. Morbidity and mortality can result from diarrheal diseases, respiratory diseases, and malnutrition. Mortality exceeding a baseline of one death per 10,000 people per day is the index of concern.
The public health importance of an epidemic disease results from the number of persons at risk, risk of fatal cases or sequelae, speed of spread, disruption of social life and economic losses, possible contamination of water supply, food chains, local animal reservoirs and vectors, the risk of new epidemic situation and difficulty and cost associated with prevention and control.
Quick response is essential because epidemics, which result in human and economic losses and political difficulties, often rise rapidly. An epidemic or threatened epidemic can become an emergency when the following characteristics of the events are present. Not all of the characteristics need to be present and each must be assessed with regard to relative importance equally:
36

 Risk of introduction to and spread of the disease in the population;
 Large number of cases may reasonably be expected to occur ;
 Disease involved is of such severity as to lead to serious disability or death;
 Risk of social or economic disruption resulting from the presence of the disease;
 Authorities are unable to cope adequately with the situation due to insufficient technical or professional, organizational experiences, and necessary supplies or equipment (eg. Drugs, vaccines, laboratory diagnostic materials, vector control materials, etc.);
 Risk of international transmission.
Public health intervention:
Successful intervention requires rapid assessment to determine whether the breakdown points of infrastructure have occurred. Disaster managers, public health specialists, and health care providers should pay specific attention to the degree to which infection control measures have been affected during the acute disaster phase and should repair those defects and treat the cases that have been known.
2.5. Pest Infestation
Pest infestation can cause tremendous damage to crop production and thus undermine the food security of a particular area. Locust
37

(desert and migratory) and grasshopper’s infestations are the main threats in sub-Saharan Africa. Current pest monitoring and control programs together with the promotion of agricultural diversity have lessened, though by no means eradicated, the threats of food shortages due to infestation.
The spread of emergent diseases and invasive species has increased dramatically in recent years. At the same time, numerous developments - such as the rapidly increasing trans-boundary movements of goods and people, trade liberalization, increasing concerns about food safety and the environment - have heightened the need for international cooperation in controlling and managing trans-boundary pests and diseases.
Certain basic conditions affect the likelihood of trans-boundary pests and diseases establishing and spreading in regions or countries. These include: climate; geographical isolation; crops and livestock produced; production systems used; hosts and vectors widespread in or native to the country; and control methods used as part of routine agricultural management.
Recent food safety issues related to diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and avian flu have become a serious concern for consumers, farmers, food processors, food retailers and governments alike. Furthermore, food contamination with non-authorized food additives, chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and acryl amide, microbiological pathogens (Salmonella, E. coli,) and mycotoxins, among others,
38

have created worldwide concern regarding the safety of food supplies. To better address the existing and emerging challenges, FAO is recommending, as well as applying, a comprehensive approach, food chain approach, to food safety and quality issues that shares the responsibility for providing safe food among all players in the food and agricultural sector, from food producers and processors to retailers and consumer households.
Management/ Public health intervention:
FAO recommends complementing regulation and control of end products, currently the main focus of many food safety programs, with preventive measures to control the introduction of hazards. This requires the adoption of good practices - in primary production, post- harvest, processing and handling - that reduce the risk of microbiological and chemical contamination. In-plant controls of food processing operations should be based on:
 Good Hygienic Practices (GHP),
 Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and
 The Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system,
which identifies and then monitors the most vulnerable points in a food production system.
2.6. Floods
Magnitude: Global statistics show that floods are the most frequently recorded destructive events, accounting for about 30% of the world’s disasters each year. The frequency of floods is
39

increasing faster than any type of disaster. Much of this rise in incidence can be attributed to uncontrolled urbanization, deforestation, and more recently, the effect of El Niño. Floods may also accompany other natural disasters, such as sea surges during hurricanes and tsunamis following earthquake.
Impact
Flood effects can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins and multiple communities. Except for flash floods, flooding causes few deaths. Widespread and long-lasting detrimental effects include mass homelessness, disruption of communications and health care systems, and heavy loss of business, livestock, crops, and grain, particularly in densely populated, low lying areas like that of the Awash Valley. The frequent repetition of flooding means a constant or even increasing drain on the economy for rural as well as urban populations.
Acute effect: The early health effects of floods include death through drowning and accidents such as falls, electrocution and the effect of landslides. People lose their homes and often also lose their source of food and water. If the drinking water supply and sanitation system is already inadequate, flooding poses a further major health threat. Sanitation is a major problem in all flooded areas, as demonstrated by recent floods in Mexico, Ghana Mozambique and in Ethiopia. Industrial waste, such as engine oil and refuse dumps, adds to the health risks of floods.
40

The severe flooding in China in 1998 killed more than 5,500 people and left at least 21 million homeless (Kriner, 1999).
Long term effect: In addition to the acute effects, the floodwaters provide an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes and an increased risk of diseases such as dengue, malaria and Rift Valley Fever. They also displace rodent populations, which may cause human outbreaks of leptospirosis and Hantavirus infection. The combined effects of open sewage and reduced opportunities for good personal hygiene also favor the spread of infections causing diarrhea, such as cholera and gastrointestinal viruses. Flooding in the horn of Africa in 1997, associated with ENSO, and caused an upsurge in cholera deaths due to the lethal combination of damage to sanitation and contamination of water supplies (WHO, 1998). During flooding in Bolivia and Peru in the mid 1980s, increases in diarrheal diseases and acute respiratory diseases were recorded (WHO, 1999). Prolonged heavy rainfall causes fewer deaths than floods, but the infection risk is just as high in areas of poor sanitation.
Flooding affects health indirectly through the widespread damage to the infrastructure of a community: its roads, buildings, equipment, drainage, sewerage and water supply systems. For example, during flooding in Peru in 1997/98, nearly a tenth of the health facilities were damaged: in Ecuador during the same period 2% of the hospitals were put out of action by a combination of flooding, mud, damage to sewerage systems and contamination of the drinking water supply. The mental distress of flooding may
41

persist long after the floods have receded, since people have lost their homes, their livelihood and their confidence.
Risk of morbidity and mortality
Flood related mortality varies from country to country. Flash flooding such as from excessive rainfall or sudden release of water from a dam, is the cause of most flood-related deaths. Most flood-related death victims become trapped in their car and drown when attempting to drive through (or attempting to cross in the case of rural settings) rising of swiftly moving water. Other deaths have been caused by wading, bicycling, or other recreational activities in flooded areas.
Life-threatening characteristics of floods:
 Absence of warning of a flood (either ‘official’ warning or warning derived from cues e.g. heavy rain).
 High floodwater velocities (like in hilly or mountainous terrain or where stream disgorge on to plains from upland areas; in river valleys with steep gradients; in areas behind floods embankments or natural barriers which may breach or overtop, below dams which may break).
 Rapid speed of flood onset (like in areas when streams are ‘flashy’ i.e. rise and fall rapidly; these are usually urban areas or arid rural areas where soil surface becomes compacted and hard; or in areas where high floodwater velocities are expected).
42

 Deep floodwater: where floodwater is in excess of one meter depth (occurs in or close to river channels; in depression which may not be easy to identify by eye; behind overtopped flood embankments and in basements of buildings).
 Long duration floods (like where land is flat, flooding is extensive; river gradients are very low, channels are obstructed, and flood water become trapped behind natural or artificial barriers).
 Flood has more than one peak (not atypical on complex river systems where tributaries contribute to river flows, or where flooding is tidal).
 Debris load of floodwaters (usually greatest in high velocity floods; floodwater may contain trees, building debris etc which may either provide floating refuge, or threaten life).
 Characteristics of accompanying weather (especially windy, unusually cold or hot weather).
 Flood may display combinations of characteristics! Management/ Protective Measures
Before a Flood, you should:
• Avoid building in a floodplain unless you elevate and reinforce your home.
• Elevate the furnace, water heater, and electric panel if susceptible to flooding.
• Install "check valves" in sewer traps to prevent flood water from backing up into the drains of your home.
43

• Construct barriers (levees, beams, floodwalls) to stop floodwater from entering the building.
• Seal walls in basements with waterproofing compounds to avoid seepage.
• Learning swimming skill is helpful. During a Flood
If a flood is likely in your area, you should:
• Listen to the radio or television for information.
• Be aware that flash flooding can occur. If there is any possibility of a flash flood, move immediately to higher
ground. Do not wait for instructions to move.
• Be aware of streams, drainage channels, canyons, and
other areas known to flood suddenly. Flash floods can occur in these areas with or without such typical warnings as rain clouds or heavy rain.
If you must prepare to evacuate, you should do the following:
• Secure your home. If you have time, bring in outdoor furniture. Move essential items to an upper floor.
• Turn off utilities at the main switches or valves if instructed to do so. Disconnect electrical appliances. Do not touch electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in water.
If you have to leave your home, remember these evacuation tips:
44

• Do not walk through moving water. Six inches of moving water can make you fall. If you have to walk in water, walk where the water is not moving. Use a stick to check the firmness of the ground in front of you.
• Do not drive into flooded areas. If flood-waters rise around your car, abandon the car and move to higher ground if you can do so safely.
After a Flood:
The following are guidelines for the period following a flood:
• Listen for news reports to learn whether the community’s water supply is safe to drink.
• Avoid floodwaters; water may be contaminated by oil, gasoline, or raw sewage. Water may also be electrically charged from underground or downed power lines.
• Avoid moving water.
• Be aware of areas where floodwaters have receded. Roads
may have weakened and could collapse under the weight of
a car.
• Stay away from downed power lines, and report them to the
power authorities.
• Return home only when authorities indicate it is safe.
• Stay out of any building if it is surrounded by floodwaters.
• Use extreme caution when entering buildings; there may be
hidden damage, particularly in foundations.
45

• Service damaged septic tanks, cesspools, pits, and leaching systems as soon as possible. Damaged sewage systems are serious health hazards.
• Clean and disinfect everything that got wet. Mud left from floodwater can contain sewage and chemicals.
Public Health Interventions
 Conduct needs assessment to determine the status of public health infrastructure, utilities (e.g. water, sewage, electricity), and health, medical, and pharmaceutical needs.
 Conduct surveillance of drinking water sources, injuries, increases in vector populations, and endemic, water-borne and vector-borne diseases.
 Organize delivery of health care services and supplies, and continuity of care.
 Educate public regarding proper sanitation and hygiene.
 Educate public regarding proper clean up.
2.7. Tsunamis
Definition: A tsunami is a series of waves generated by an under sea disturbance such as an earthquake. From the area of the disturbance, the waves will travel outward in all directions, much like the ripples caused by throwing a rock into a pond. As the waves approach the shallow coastal waters, they appear normal and speed decreases. Then as the tsunami nears coastline, it may grow to a great height and smash into the shore, causing such destruction.
46

Tsunamis (pronounced soo-ná-mees), also known as seismic sea waves (mistakenly called “tidal waves”), are a series of enormous waves created by an underwater disturbance such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite. A tsunami can move hundreds of miles per hour in the open ocean and smash into land with waves as high as 100 feet or more.
Protective Measures
Guidelines for what you should do if a tsunami is likely in your area:
• Turn on your radio to learn if there is a tsunami warning
• Move inland to higher ground immediately and stay there.
• If there is noticeable recession in water away from the
shoreline this is nature's tsunami warning and it should be heeded. You should move away immediately
Guidelines for the period following a tsunami:
• Stay away from flooded and damaged areas until officials say it is safe to return.
• Stay away from debris in the water; it may pose a safety hazard to boats and people.
2.8. Earthquakes
Definition: Earthquakes are sudden slippages or movements in a portion of the earth's crust accompanied by a series of vibrations. Aftershocks of similar or lesser intensity can follow the main quake.
47

Earthquakes can occur at any time of the year. An earthquake is generally considered to be the most destructive and frightening of all forces of nature.
Magnitude:
The Richter scale, used as an indication of the force of an earthquake, measures the magnitude and intensity or energy released by the quake. This value is calculated based on data recordings from a single observation point for events anywhere on earth, but it does not address the possible damaging effects of the earthquake. According to global observations, an average of two earthquakes of a Richter magnitude 8 or slightly more occur every year. A one digit drop in magnitude equates with a tenfold increase in frequency. Therefore, earthquakes of magnitude 7 or more generally occur 20 times in a year, while those with a magnitude 6 or more occur approximately 200 times.
Specific active seismic zones have been identified around the globe. Millions of people live in these seismic zones and are exposed to threat of an earthquake daily. The damage caused by an earthquake can be extensive especially to incompatible building types and construction techniques. Also, an earthquake usually ignite fires, which can spread rapidly among damaged buildings if the water system has been disabled and fire services cannot access the site of the fire.
48

Impact
Earthquake losses, like those of other disasters, tend to cause more financial losses in industrialized countries and, as the developed countries have better early warning systems and life saving means, more injuries and deaths occur in undeveloped countries. Deaths and injuries from earthquakes vary according to the type of housing available, time of day of occurrence, and population density. Common injuries include cuts, broken bones, crush injuries, and dehydration from being trapped in rubble. Stress reactions are also common. Morbidity and mortality can occur during the actual quake, the delayed collapse of unsound structures, or clean-up activity.
Public health intervention
Public health officials can intervene both in advance of and after earthquakes to prevent post-earthquake injuries. The safety of homes and the work environment can be improved by building standards that require stricter codes and use of safer materials. Measures to prevent injuries include securing appliances, securing hanging items on walls or overhead, turning off utilities, storing hazardous materials in safe, well-ventilated areas, and checking homes for hazards such as windows and glass that might shatter.
49

Protective Measures Before an Earthquake:
• Repair defective electrical wiring, leaky gas cylinders, and inflexible utility connections.
• Place large or heavy objects on lower shelves. Fasten shelves, mirrors, and large picture frames to walls.
• Store bottled foods, glass, china clay, and other breakables on low shelves or in cabinets that fasten shut.
• Anchor overhead lighting fixtures.
• Be sure the residence is firmly anchored to its foundation.
Install flexible pipe fittings to avoid gas or water leaks. Flexible fittings are more
• Resistant to breakage.
• Locate safe spots in each room under a sturdy table or
against an inside wall.
• Hold earthquake drills with your family members: Drop,
cover, and hold on!
During an Earthquake: minimize your movements during an earthquake to a few steps to a nearby safe place. Stay indoors until the shaking has stopped and you are sure exiting is safe.
I. If you are indoor:
50

• Take cover under a sturdy desk, table, or bench or against an inside wall, and hold on. If there isn’t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.
• Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture.
• Stay in bed - if you are there when the earthquake strikes - hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.
• Use a doorway for shelter only if it is in close proximity to you and if you know it is a strongly supported, load bearing doorway.
• Stay inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Most injuries during earthquakes occur when people are hit by falling objects when entering into or exiting from buildings.
• Be aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on.
• DO NOT use elevators.
II. If you are Outdoors:
• Move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires. III. If you are In a moving vehicle:
51

• Stop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires.
• Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped, watching for road and bridge damage.
IV. If you are trapped under debris:
• Do not light a match. Do not move about or kick up dust.
• Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing.
• Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you. Use a
whistle if one is available. Shout only as a last resort - shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust.
After an Earthquake: be prepared for aftershocks. These secondary shockwaves are usually less violent than the main quake, but can be strong enough to do additional damage to weakened structures.
• Open cabinets cautiously. Beware of objects that can fall off shelves.
• Stay away from damaged areas unless your assistance has been specifically requested by police, fire, or relief organizations.
• Be aware of possible tsunamis if you live in coastal areas.
52

Public health interventions:
 Encourage earthquake drills to practice emergency procedures;
 Recommend items for inclusion in an extensive first aid kit and survival kit for home and automobile, and encourage maintenance of those kits;
 Teach basic precautions regarding safe water and safe food;
 Ensure the provision of emergency medical care to those who seek immediate care in the first three to five days after
an earthquake;
 Ensure continuity of care for those who have lost access to
prescriptions, home care, and other medical necessities;
 Conduct surveillance for communicable disease and injuries, including location and severity of injury, disposition of
patients, and follow up contact information;
 Prepare media advisories with appropriate warning and
advice for injury prevention;
 Establish environmental control;
 Facilitate use of surveillance forms by search and rescue
teams to record types of buildings, addresses of site, type of collapse, amount of dust, fire or toxic hazards, location of victims, and nature and severity of injuries.
53

2.9. Pollutions and health consequences of pollutions:
Definition:
Pollution: is undesirable state of the natural environment being contaminated with harmful substances as a consequence of human activities. Pollution is the contamination of the air, water, or earth by harmful or potentially harmful substances.
Over the past 100 years, the state of the terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments has declined in virtually all respects. Environmental degradation and resource depletion have escalated particularly over the past three decades due to the cumulative impacts of rapid growth in population, intensive agriculture, urbanization and industrialization. The priority list of environmental challenges includes land degradation, deforestation, declining biodiversity and marine resources, water scarcity, and deteriorating water and air quality.
A major reason for these adverse environmental trends in Africa is that most people and countries are poor. Their poverty is both a cause and a consequence of environmental degradation. However, the main cause of many environmental problems is the persistence of economic, agricultural, energy, industrial and other sectoral policies which largely neglect - and fail to avoid - harmful impacts on the environment and natural resource base.
54

2.9.1. Air pollution:
Air pollution is the presence in the air of substances put there by the acts of man in concentrations sufficient to interfere with health, comfort, or safety, or with full use and enjoyment of property.
The term is often used to identify undesirable substances produced by human activity. Air pollution usually designates the collection of substances that adversely affect human health, animals, and plants; deteriorates structures; interferes with commerce; or interferes with the enjoyment of life.
Primary Pollutants & their Health Effects:
Particulate Matter (PM):
Particulate matter consists of soot and dust particles that are smaller than the diameter of a human hair. Particulate matter is all particles smaller than 10 microns in diameter are classified as PM10 or coarse size particles. Fine size particles, or PM2.5, are those particles less than or equal to 2.5 microns in diameter. Sources of PM include diesel exhaust, soil dust, tire wear, and soot. These particles penetrate deeply into the lungs and are captured by lung tissue. A major contributor to the PM pollution problem is exhaust from diesel vehicles, which produce 79% of the particulate emissions from mobile sources. Exposure to PM pollution has been associated with respiratory and cardiac problems, infections, asthma attacks, lung cancer and decreased life expectancy. The World Health Organization has estimated that 500,000 premature
55

deaths each year may be associated with PM pollution. The American Lung Association believes that PM2.5 represents the most serious threat to our health. Segments of the population that are more susceptible to PM pollution include children, athletes, senior citizens, and people with pre-existing respiratory problems.
Ozone (O3)
Ozone forms when hydrocarbons combine with nitrogen oxides and chemically react in sunlight. Hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides are primarily produced by motor vehicles and various industrial practices. Ozone is a highly reactive oxidizing agent that breaks- down organic materials. Ozone is the primary component of smog. A natural phenomenon called an "inversion layer" traps these gases and prevents them from dissipating into the atmosphere. Symptoms of ozone exposure are coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, fatigue, throat dryness, chest pain, headache and nausea. Ozone has been shown to cause inflammation of lung tissue and reduced lung capacity. Development of asthma, increased lung cancer mortality rates, and accelerated lung aging has all been linked to ozone exposure. Lung damage from long-term exposure to ozone can be permanent, while short-term exposure appears to be reversible. Ozone reduces the respiratory system's ability to fight infection and remove foreign particles such as particulate matter. Segments of the population that are more susceptible to ozone pollution include children, athletes, senior citizens, and people with pre-existing respiratory problems.
56

Hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbons are a class of reactive organic gases (ROG), which are formed solely of hydrogen and carbon. Hydrocarbons contribute to the formation of ozone and the resulting smog problem. Carcinogenic forms of hydrocarbons are considered hazardous air pollutants, or air toxics. The incomplete burning of any organic matter such as oil, wood, or rubber produces hydrocarbons. Combustion engine exhaust, oil refineries, and oil-fueled power plants are the primary sources of hydrocarbons. Another source of hydrocarbons is evaporation from petroleum fuels, solvents, dry cleaning solutions, and paint. The primary health effect of hydrocarbons results from the formation of ozone and its related health effects. High levels of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere can interfere with oxygen intake by reducing the amount of available oxygen through displacement.
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): Nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
 The two forms of nitrogen oxide found in the atmosphere.
 Contribute to the formation of ozone, production of
particulate matter pollution, and acid deposition.
 Produced by factories, motor vehicles and power plants that
burn fossil fuels
 NO2 irritates lung tissue, causes bronchitis and pneumonia,
and reduces resistance to respiratory infections
57

 Frequent or long-term exposure to high levels of nitrogen oxides can increase the incidence of acute respiratory illness in children.
Carbon Monoxide (CO)
 CO is colorless, odorless gas produced by burning organic matter such as oil, natural gas, fuel, wood, and charcoal.
 Displaces oxygen in red blood cells, which reduces the
amount of oxygen that human cells need for respiration.
 Exposure to CO can result in fatigue, angina, reduced visual
perception, reduced dexterity, and death.
 The elderly, young children, and people with pre-existing
respiratory conditions are particularly sensitive
 Extremely deadly in an enclosed space, such as a garage or
bedroom.
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)
 A colorless gas produced by motor vehicles, refineries, and power plants that burn fossil fuels.
 Reduces respiratory volume, and increases breathing resistance in those exposed, especially asthmatics.
 Increases nasal airway resistance. 2.9.2. Water pollution and contamination
Water is necessary for industries which are therefore often located near a river. Thus, natural disasters may not only affect the water
58

resources and their management directly but floods and earthquakes may also destroy industries producing or using toxic materials or dangerous chemicals which might be released into floodwaters.
These harmful materials include organic wastes, sediments, minerals, nutrients, thermal pollutants, toxic chemicals, and other hazardous substances. Organic wastes are produced by animals and humans, and include such things as fecal matter, crop debris, yard clippings, food wastes, and rubber, plastic, wood, and disposable diapers.
Their origin is human industrial activity and they can be avoided through properly applied policies and good decision making. With increased urbanization, increase in population density and industrialization, the problem of pollution might also become more important. The polluted water may cause death or diseases by poisoning.
Worldwide, a considerable number of diseases are linked to the interrelated problems of water quality, water availability, sanitation and hygiene.
Natural networks of rivers, lakes and marshes, also play a role in the transmission of water-related and vector-borne diseases. If these undergo increased flooding, community water supplies could become contaminated, leading to greater incidence of faecal-oral diseases such as cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A and diarrhea.
59

Developing countries are at most risk with respect to waterborne and Water-washed diseases and urban communities are at greater risk than rural communities.
Any increase in heavy precipitation and consequently in runoff from agricultural lands, would also be likely to increase contamination of water with chemicals such as pesticides.
2.10. Global warming
How might the climate change?
The earth's climate is predicted to change because human activities are altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the buildup of greenhouse gases primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The heat-trapping property of these gases is undisputed. Although uncertainty exists about exactly how earth's climate responds to these gases, global temperatures are rising.
Scientists use computer-based models to predict the effects on global climate of different levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. According to the most recent projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global mean temperature could increase by 1.4°C to 5.8°C between 1990 and 2100.
The climatic effects of such a temperature increase might include:
60

• More frequent extreme high maximum temperatures and less frequent extreme low minimum temperatures;
• An increase in the variability of climate, with changes to both the frequency and severity of extreme weather events;
• Alterations to the natural biological range of certain infectious diseases;
• Rising sea levels.
Effects of global warming
Global warming can be expected to produce changes in the frequency of intense rainfall. Higher sea-surface temperatures can be expected to increase the intensity of tropical cyclones and to expand the area over which they may develop. Rainfall intensity is likely to increase with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and there may be an increasing concentration of rainfall on fewer rain days.
As climatic warming occurs, there will be notable changes in the hydrology of Arctic areas. River-ice regime might be altered and substantial effects on the hydrology can be expected that will affect flow, water levels, and storage. It is reasonable to think that an increase in the frequency and intensity of floods may be associated with an increase in the occurrence and severity of droughts in order to compensate the first extreme and to reestablish the natural energy and water balance.
61

Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation as the result of global warming
Overexposure to UV radiation in sunlight can result in painful sunburn. It can also lead to more serious health effects, including skin cancer, premature aging of the skin, and other skin disorders; cataracts and other eye damage; and immune system suppression.
Perhaps the most obvious impact of global warming will be the direct effects: a warmer planet will experience more extreme heat waves. As seen in Europe, the scorching weather may have claimed as many as 35,000 lives in 2003; heat waves often lead to an increase in the number of human deaths.
Technological adaptations such as the installation of effective air- conditioners and the construction of heat-minimizing houses will happen more quickly among the rich, so heat waves are likely to have a disproportionate effect in less-developed countries and in the poorer segments of rich societies.
Rising sea levels as the result of global warming
Global warming is predicted to lead to thermal expansion of sea water. Scientists predict that sea levels will rise as the global temperature rises, due to the melting of land-based ice in the Polar Regions and glaciers, and the thermal expansion of the oceans. According to the most recent projections, sea levels could rise between 9 and 88 centimeters by the year 2100. A rise of this magnitude would have disastrous consequences for people living on
62

low-lying islands, such as the Maldives group in the Indian Ocean and many South Pacific islands. In parts of Egypt, Bangladesh, Indonesia, China, the Netherlands, Florida, and other low-lying coastal areas already suffering from poor drainage, agriculture is likely to become increasingly difficult to sustain.
Higher sea levels lead to coastal flooding and an increase in the frequency of extreme high water levels from storm surges. Related problems are the contamination of coastal freshwater supplies with encroaching sea water, and the degradation of fishing and agricultural areas.
Infectious diseases as the result of global warming:
Many infectious diseases are dependent on vector organisms, which are sensitive to environmental factors and therefore will be affected by global warming. Biological modeling under various climate scenarios suggests a widening of the potential transmission zone of some disease-causing pathogens and their vectors, such as mosquitoes.
Scientists speculate that if temperatures rise under global warming, the incidence of diseases caused by food-poisoning and by the contamination of drinking (and swimming) water could increase dramatically.
63

Extreme events and disasters as the result of global warming:
Most computer models generated by scientists indicate that the future climate will be more variable than the past and those droughts and floods will be more severe. Some of the health effects of weather-related disasters, in addition to the immediate death and injury to people and damage to property, include:
• Increases in psychological stress, depression, and feelings of isolation amongst people affected by natural disasters;
• Decreases in nutrition due to poorer agricultural yields
caused, for example, by prolonged drought and problems of
food distribution;
• Increases in disease transmission due to a breakdown in
sewerage and garbage services.
Effects of Climate Variations and Climate Change
Climate variations is a term referring to year to year or inter-annual fluctuations in the annual cycle, including also anomalous cycles ranging from two to ten years in duration.
Climate variability persistent over a ten years period is referred to as climate change. Scientists are now increasingly able to link extreme weather events such as droughts and storms with climate variations and climate change. The Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 1995) concluded that: there is evidence, from climate models and hydrological impact studies, which flood frequencies, are likely to increase with global warming.
64

Climate change may increase the risk of death, according to World Health Organization report of 2006. Many important diseases that affect developing countries are sensitive to climate variations, according to the report, and even a proportionally small change in the global incidence of some diseases could result in significant public health impacts far into the future. The authors of Climate Change and Human Health: Risks and Responses quantified the relative risk of death in 2030 from diarrhea, malaria, and cardiovascular disease related to heat and cold, malnutrition, and flooding in several developed and developing regions (22).
"Provision of clean water and sanitation not only cuts overall diarrhea rates, but also decreases the importance of the bacterial pathogens that respond positively to temperature, and decreases risks of diarrhea outbreaks following floods."
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
One of the most spectacular climate variation consequences is El- Niño.
The El Niño event, a warm water current along the coast of Peru and Chile, is part of a climatic phenomenon known as the El-Niño- Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which strongly affects tropical and mid- latitude countries. Impacts of ENSO are droughts over Southeast Asia, northeastern Brazil and southern Africa, heavy rains in the tropical Pacific and the west coast of the Americas at tropical and mid-latitudes. The generation of ENSO is not yet fully understood. Its recurrence interval varies from two to seven years, with an average of four years.

Figure 6: Effects of climate change on the ecosystem 2.11. Ozone depletion:
The Connection between Ozone Depletion and UVB Radiation: Reductions in ozone levels will not result in the sun's output of UVB change; rather, less ozone means less protection, and will lead to higher levels of UVB reaching the Earth's surface hence more UVB reaches the Earth. Studies have shown that in the Antarctic, the amount of UVB measured at the surface can double during the annual ozone hole. Another study confirmed the relationship
66
 
between reduced ozone and increased UVB levels in Canada during the past several years.
UVB is a kind of ultraviolet light from the sun (and sun lamps) that has adverse effects on lives. Particularly it is effective at damaging DNA. It is a cause of melanoma and other types of skin cancer. It has also been linked to damage to some materials, crops, and marine organisms. The ozone layer protects the Earth against most UVB coming from the sun. It is always important to protect oneself against UVB, even in the absence of ozone depletion, by wearing hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen.
Causes of Ozone Depletion
Ozone depletion occurs when the natural balance between the production and destruction of stratospheric ozone is tipped in favour of destruction. Although natural phenomena can cause temporary ozone loss, chlorine and bromine released from man-made compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are now accepted as the main cause of this depletion.
It was first suggested by Drs. M. Molina and S. Rowland in 1974 that a man-made group of compounds known as the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were likely to be the main source of ozone depletion. However, this idea was not seriously taken until the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica in 1985 by the British Antarctic Survey.
67

Chlorofluorocarbons are not "washed" back to Earth by rain or destroyed in reactions with other chemicals. They simply do not break down in the lower atmosphere and they can remain in the atmosphere from 20 to 120 years or more. As a consequence of their relative stability, CFCs are instead transported into the stratosphere where they are eventually broken down by ultraviolet (UV) rays from the Sun, releasing free chlorine. The chlorine becomes actively involved in the process of destruction of ozone. The net result is that two molecules of ozone are replaced by three of molecular oxygen, leaving the chlorine free to repeat the process:
Cl+O3 ClO+O2
ClO + O  Cl + O2
Ozone is converted to oxygen, leaving the chlorine atom free to repeat the process up to 100,000 times, resulting in a reduced level of ozone. Bromine compounds, or halons, can also destroy stratospheric ozone. Compounds containing chlorine and bromine from man-made compounds are known as industrial halocarbons. Emissions of CFCs have accounted for roughly 80% of total stratospheric ozone depletion.
The problem of ozone depletion is caused by high levels of chlorine and bromine compounds in the stratosphere. The origins of these compounds are chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), used as cooling substances in air-conditioners and refrigerators, or as aerosol propellants, and bromofluorocarbons (halons), used in fire
68

extinguishers. As a result of depletion of the ozone layer more UV radiation comes to Earth and causes damage to living organisms. UV radiation seems responsible for skin cancer in humans; it lowers production of phytoplankton, and thus affects other aquatic organisms. It can also influence the growth of terrestrial plants.
The Effects of Ozone Depletion
On Human Health
Laboratory and epidemiological studies demonstrate that UVB causes nonmelanoma skin cancer and plays a major role in malignant melanoma development. In addition, UVB has been linked to cataracts. All sunlight contains some UVB, even with normal ozone levels. It is always important to limit exposure to the sun. However, ozone depletion will increase the amount of UVB and the risk of health effects.
On Plants
Physiological and developmental processes of plants are affected by UVB radiation, even by the amount of UVB in present-day sunlight. Despite mechanisms to reduce or repair these effects and a limited ability to adapt to increased levels of UVB, plant growth can be directly affected by UVB radiation.
Indirect changes caused by UVB (such as changes in plant form, how nutrients are distributed within the plant, timing of developmental phases and secondary metabolism) may be equally, or sometimes more, important than damaging effects of UVB. These
69

changes can have important implications for plant competitive balance, herbivory, plant diseases, and biogeochemical cycles.
On Marine Ecosystems
Phytoplankton forms the foundation of aquatic food webs. Phytoplankton productivity is limited to the euphotic zone, the upper layer of the water column in which there is sufficient sunlight to support net productivity. The position of the organisms in the euphotic zone is influenced by the action of wind and waves. In addition, many phytoplanktons are capable of active movements that enhance their productivity and, therefore, their survival. Exposure to solar UVB radiation has been shown to affect both orientation mechanisms and motility in phytoplankton, resulting in reduced survival rates for these organisms. Scientists have demonstrated a direct reduction in phytoplankton production due to ozone depletion- related increases in UVB. One study has indicated a 6-12% reduction in the marginal ice zone (43).
Solar UVB radiation has been found to cause damage to early developmental stages of fish, shrimp, crab, amphibians and other animals. The most severe effects are decreased reproductive capacity and impaired larval development. Even at current levels, solar UVB radiation is a limiting factor, and small increases in UVB exposure could result in significant reduction in the size of the population of animals that eat these smaller creatures.
70

On Biogeochemical Cycles
Increases in solar UV radiation could affect terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemical cycles, thus altering both sources and sinks of greenhouse and chemically-important trace gases e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbonyl sulfide (COS) and possibly other gases, including ozone. These potential changes would contribute to biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks that attenuate or reinforce the atmospheric buildup of these gases.
UVB: a band of ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths from 280-320 nanometers produced by the Sun
UVC: a band of ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths shorter than 280 nanometers
2.12. Tornado
Tornados are rapidly whirling, funnel-shaped air spirals that emerge from a violent thunderstorm and reach the ground. Tornados can have a wind velocity of up to 200 miles per hour and generate sufficient force to destroy even massive buildings. The extent of damage depends on updrafts within the tornado funnel, the tornado's atmospheric pressure (which is often lower than the surrounding barometric pressure), and the effects of flying debris.
Risk of Morbidity and Mortality
Injuries from tornados occur due to flying debris or people being thrown by the high winds (i.e., head injuries, soft tissue injury, and
71

secondary wound infection). Stress-related disorders are more common, as is disease related to loss of utilities, potable water, or shelter.
Injury Prevention
In the event of a tornado, the residents should take shelter in a basement if possible, away from windows, while protecting their heads. People with special needs should have a "buddy" who has a copy of the list and who knows of the emergency box.
Public Health Interventions
• Work with emergency management on tornado shelter drills for vulnerable communities.
• Conduct needs assessment using maps that detail pre- existing neighborhoods, including landmarks, and aerial reconnaissance.
• Ensure the provision of medical care, shelter, food, and water.
• Establish environmental controls.
• Establish a surveillance system based at both clinical sites and shelters.
72

2.13. Fires
There are two types of fire disasters. They are domestic and wild fires. Fires can be triggered or exacerbated by lightning, high winds, earthquakes, volcanoes, floods and deliberate setting of fire by human beings. Lightning is the most significant natural contributor to fires affecting the building environment. Buildings with rooftop storage tanks for flammable liquids are particularly susceptible.
To protect yourself, it is important to understand the basic characteristics of fire. Fire spreads quickly; there is no time to gather valuables or make a phone call. In just two minutes, a fire can become life-threatening. In five minutes, a residence can be engulfed in flames. Heat and smoke from fire can be more dangerous than the flames. Inhaling the super-hot air can sear your lungs. Fire produces poisonous gases that make you disoriented and drowsy. Instead of being awakened by a fire, you may fall into a deeper sleep. Asphyxiation is the leading cause of fire deaths, exceeding burns by a three-to-one ratio.
Management
Before a Fire (mostly for developed countries)
Smoke Alarms
• Install smoke alarms. Properly working smoke alarms decrease your chances of dying in a fire by half.
73

• Place smoke alarms on every level of your residence. Place them outside bedrooms on the ceiling or high on the wall (4 to 12 inches from ceiling), at the top of open stairways, or at the bottom of enclosed stairs and near (but not in) the kitchen.
• Test and clean smoke alarms once a month and replace batteries at least once a year. Replace smoke alarms once every 10 years.
• Have record of fire brigades telephone in safe and accessible to member of the family.
• Making aware the people about care (prevention), escape mechanisms.
Escaping the Fire
• Review escape routes with your family. Practice escaping from each room.
• Make sure windows are not nailed or painted shut. Make sure security gratings on windows have a fire safety opening feature so they can be easily opened from the inside.
• Consider escape ladders if your residence has more than one level, and ensure that burglar bars and other antitheft mechanisms that block outside window entry are easily opened from the inside.
• Teach family members to stay low to the floor (where the air is safer in a fire) when escaping from a fire.
• Clean out storage areas. Do not let trash, such as old newspapers, magazines, other materials and equipments accumulation.
74

With regards to Flammable Items
• Never use gasoline, benzene, naphtha, or similar flammable liquids indoors.
• Store flammable liquids in approved containers in well- ventilated storage areas.
• Never smoke near flammable liquids.
• Discard all rags or materials that have been soaked in
flammable liquids after you have used them. Safely discard
them outdoors in a metal container.
• Insulate chimneys and place spark arresters on top. The
chimney should be at least three feet higher than the roof. Remove branches hanging above and around the chimney.
With regards to Heating Sources
• Be careful when using alternative heating sources.
• Place heaters at least three feet away from flammable materials. Make sure the floor and nearby walls are properly
insulated.
• Use only the type of fuel designated for your unit and follow
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Store ashes in a metal container outside and away from
your residence.
• Keep open flames away from walls, furniture, drapery, and
flammable items.
• Keep a screen in front of the fireplace.
75

• Have heating units inspected and cleaned annually by a certified specialist.
With regards to Matches and Smoking
• Keep matches and lighters up high, away from children, and, if possible, in a locked cabinet.
• Never smoke in bed or when drowsy or medicated. Provide smokers with deep, sturdy ashtrays. Douse cigarette and cigar butts with water before disposal.
With regards to Electrical Wiring
• Have the electrical wiring in your residence checked by an electrician.
• Inspect extension cords for frayed or exposed wires or loose plugs.
• Make sure outlets have cover plates and no exposed wiring.
• Make sure wiring does not run under rugs, over nails, or
across high-traffic areas.
• Do not overload extension cords or outlets. If you need to
plug in two or three appliances, get a UL-approved unit with
built-in circuit breakers to prevent sparks and short circuits.
• Make sure insulation does not touch bare electrical wiring.
Other Precautions
• Sleep with your door closed.
76

• Install fire extinguishers in your residence and teach family members how to use them.
• Consider installing an automatic fire sprinkler system in your residence.
• Ask your local fire department to inspect your residence for fire safety and prevention.
• Make buildings accessible to water source During a Fire:
If your clothes catch on fire, you should:
• Stop, drop, and roll - until the fire is extinguished. Running only makes the fire burn faster.
To escape a fire, you should:
• Check closed doors for heat before you open them. If you are escaping through a closed door, use the back of your hand to feel the top of the door, the doorknob, and the crack between the door and door frame before you open it. Never use the palm of your hand or fingers to test for heat - burning those areas could impair your ability to escape a fire (i.e., ladders and crawling).
77

   Hot Door Cool Door
    Do not open. Escape through a window. If you cannot escape, hang a white or light- colored sheet outside the window, alerting fire fighters to your presence.
    Open slowly and ensure fire and/or smoke is not blocking your escape route. If your escape route is blocked, shut the door immediately and use an alternate escape route, such as a window. If clear, leave immediately through the door and close it behind you. Be prepared to crawl. Smoke and heat rise. The air is clearer and cooler near the floor.
  • Crawl low under any smoke to your exit - heavy smoke and poisonous gases collect first along the ceiling.
• Close doors behind you as you escape to delay the spread of the fire.
• Stay out once you are safely out. Do not reenter. After a Fire
• If you are with burn victims, or are a burn victim yourself, cool and cover burns to reduce chance of further injury or infection.
• If you detect heat or smoke when entering a damaged building, evacuate immediately.
• If you are a tenant, contact the landlord.
• If you have a safe or strong box, do not try to open it. It can
hold intense heat for several hours. If the door is opened 78

before the box has cooled, the contents could burst into
flames.
• If you must leave your home because a building inspector
says the building is unsafe, ask someone you trust to watch the property during your absence.
Wildfires:
Wild land fires are classified into three categories:
 A surface fire: is the common type and burns along the floor
of a forest, moving slowly and killing or damaging the trees;
 A ground fire: is usually started by lightning and burns on or
below the forest floor;
 A crown fire: spreads rapidly by winds and moves quickly
by jumping along the top of trees. Wildland fires are usually signaled by dense smoke that fills the area for miles around.
If heavy rains follow a fire, other natural disasters can occur, including landslides, mudflows, and floods. Once ground cover has been burned away, little is left to hold soil in place on steep slopes and hillsides. If the wild land fire destroyed the ground cover, then erosion becomes one of several potential problems.
Protective Measures
Before a Wildfire
to prepare for wildfires, you should:
79

• Mark the entrance to your property with address signs that are clearly visible from the road.
• Keep lawns trimmed, leaves raked, and the roof and rain gutters free from debris such as dead limbs and leaves.
• Stack firewood at least 30 feet away from your residence.
• Store flammable materials, liquids, and solvents in metal containers outside your residence at least 30 feet away from
structures and wooden fences.
• Create defensible space by thinning trees and brush within
30 feet around your residence. Beyond 30 feet, remove
dead wood, debris, and low tree branches.
• Landscape your property with fire resistant plants and
vegetation to prevent fire from spreading quickly. For example, hardwood trees are more fire-resistant than pine, evergreen, eucalyptus, or fir trees.
• Make sure water sources, such as hydrants, ponds, swimming pools, and wells, are accessible to the fire department.
• Use fire resistant, protective roofing and materials like stone, brick, and metal to protect your residence. Avoid using wood materials.
• Cover all exterior vents, attics, and eaves with metal mesh screens to prevent debris from collecting and to help keep sparks out.
• Install multi-pane windows, tempered safety glass, or fireproof shutters to protect large windows from radiant heat.
• Use fire-resistant draperies for added window protection. 80

• Have chimneys, wood stoves, and all home heating systems inspected and cleaned annually by a certified specialist.
• Insulate chimneys and place spark arresters on top. The chimney should be at least 3 feet above the roof.
• Remove branches hanging above and around the chimney. Follow Local Burning Laws
• Before burning debris in a wooded area, make sure you notify local authorities, obtain a burning permit, and follow these guidelines:
• Use an approved incinerator with a safety lid or covering with holes no larger than 3/4 inch.
• Create at least a 10-foot clearing around the incinerator before burning debris.
• Have a fire extinguisher or garden hose on hand when burning debris.
During a Wildfire:
If a wildfire threatens your home and time permits, take the following precautions:
• Shut off gas at the meter. Only a qualified professional can safely turn the gas back on.
• Turn off propane tanks.
• Place combustible patio furniture inside.
81

• Connect garden hose to outside taps. Place lawn sprinklers on the roof and near above-ground fuel tanks. Wet the roof.
• Wet or remove shrubs within 15 feet of your residence.
• Gather fire tools such as a rake, axe, handsaw or chainsaw,
bucket, and shovel.
• Back your car into the garage or park it in an open space
facing the direction of escape.
• Shut doors and roll up windows. Leave the key in the ignition
and the car doors unlocked. Close garage windows and doors, but leave them unlocked. Disconnect automatic garage door openers.
• Open fireplace damper. Close fireplace screens.
• Close windows, vents, doors, blinds or noncombustible window coverings, and heavy drapes. Remove flammable
drapes and curtains.
• Move flammable furniture into the center of the residence
away from windows and sliding-glass doors.
• Close all interior doors and windows to prevent drafts.
• Place valuables that will not be damaged by water in a pool
or pond.
If advised to evacuate, do so immediately. Choose a route away from the fire hazard. Watch for changes in the speed and direction of the fire and smoke.
82

Risk of Morbidity and Mortality
Morbidity and mortality associated with wildfires include burns, inhalation injuries, respiratory complications, and stress-related cardiovascular events (exhaustion and myocardial infarction from fighting or fleeing the fire).
Public Health Interventions
More than four out of every five wildfires are started by people. Negligent human behavior, such as smoking in forested areas or improperly extinguishing campfires, are the causes of many forest fires. Another cause of forest fires is lightning. Prevention efforts include working with the fire service to educate people to:
 Build fires away from nearby trees or bushes,
 Be prepared to extinguish fire quickly and completely.
 Never leave a fire—even a burning cigarette—unattended.
 Encourage the development of a family wildfire evacuation
plan if the area in your community is at risk for wildfire.
2.14. Explosions
Explosions can inflict multi-system life-threatening injuries to many persons simultaneously. Contributing factors include the composition and amount of the materials involved the environment in which the event occurs, the method of delivery, such as a bomb, the distance between the victim and the blast, and the absence/presence of protective barriers or environmental hazards in the area of the blast.
83

To predict subsequent demand for medical care and resources needed, it is useful to remember that post-blast, half of the initial casualties will seek medical care over the first one-hour period. Those with minor injuries often arrive before the most severely injured, because they go directly to the closest hospitals using whatever transportation is available. Further, where the explosion has resulted in a structural collapse, victims will be more severely injured and their rescue can occur over prolonged time periods.
Morbidity and Mortality
The most common injuries for survivors of explosions are penetrating and blunt trauma. Blast lung is the most common fatal injury among initial survivors. Explosions in confined spaces (mines, buildings, or large vehicles) and/or structural collapse are associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality. Blast injuries can occur to any body system: auditory, digestive, circulatory, central nervous system, extremities, renal, and respiratory. Up to 10 percent of all blast survivors have significant eye injuries. These injuries can occur with minimal discomfort initially and patients can come for care days, weeks, or even months after the event. Symptoms include eye pain or irritation, foreign body sensation, altered vision, periorbital swelling, or contusions. Clinical findings in the gastrointestinal tract may be absent until the onset of complications. Victims can also experience tinnitus, and/or temporary or permanent deafness from blasts.
84

Public Health Interventions
o Identify the medical institutions and personnel who can provide emergency care
o Ensure that the community preparedness plan includes structure for surge capacity. To estimate the "first wave" of casualties, double the number appearing for care in the first hour. Prepare written communications and instructions for victims who may experience temporary or permanent deafness.
o Work with the regional Emergency Management Organization, police, fire, etc to have a plan in place to identify potential toxic exposures and environmental hazards for which the health department will need to help protect responders in the field and the community.
o With the hospital community, establish a victim identification registry.
o With the mental health community, plan for the reception and intervention with family and friends.

following following
3.1. Introduction
Human and economic losses due to natural disasters have continued to increase despite efforts undertaken by Governments and the international community to raise awareness of risk reduction needs, in particular fostered by the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR, 1990-1999). Global summaries for 2002 indicated the occurrence of over 500 disasters, with more than
87

10,000 people killed, 600 million people affected, US$ 55 billion in total damages and US$ 13 billion in insured losses. Developing countries are disproportionately affected, with their losses rising to about five times higher per unit of GDP than for rich countries, sometimes exceeding a year or more of hard-won and desperately needed economic development.
The underlying problems of growing vulnerability to natural and technological hazards are largely outcome of short-sighted development activities. Every day development decisions are being made at local, national and international levels. Despite their importance, these developmental activities are more often factors that increase the vulnerability to hazard than reducing the risk. In other words, the vulnerability of communities is growing due to human activities that lead to increased poverty, greater urban density, environmental degradation and climate change. In addition to the aforementioned, the prominent consequences of disasters are summarized under the following headings:
3.2. Social reactions
The nature of disasters may intensify reactions of persons impacted by the event. The scope of the event, personal loss or injuries, and traumatic stimuli, all serve to impact reactions. Though reactions to disasters may vary between individuals, there are common reactions that are normal reactions to the abnormal event. Sometimes these stress reactions appear immediately following the disaster; in some cases, they are delayed for a few hours, a few days, weeks, or even
88

months. These stress reactions may be categorized as physiological, cognitive/intellectual, emotional, and behavioral symptoms and may include the following:
Physiological Symptoms
• Fatigue
• Shock symptoms
• Nausea
• Headaches
• Vomiting
• Profuse sweating
• Fine motor tremors
• Chills
• Teeth grinding
• Muscle aches
• Dizziness
Cognitive/Intellectual Symptoms
• Memory loss
• Concentration problems/distractibility
• Reduced attention span
• Decision making difficulties
• Calculation difficulties
• Confusing trivial with major issues
89

Emotional Symptoms
• Anxiety
• Feeling overwhelmed
• Grief
• Identification with victims
• Depression
• Anticipation of harm to self or others
• Irritability
Behavioral Symptoms
• Insomnia
• Crying easily
• Substance abuse
• Gallows humor
• Gait change
• Ritualistic behavior
• Hyper vigilance
• Unwillingness to leave scene
Although these may be normal reactions to the event, persons providing disaster mental health services should recognize when reactions are severe enough to refer an individual for services of a mental health professional.
90

3.3. Factors which may affect reactions
• Lack of warning
• Scope of the event
• Abrupt contrast of scene
• Personal loss or injury
• Type of disaster
• Traumatic stimuli
• Nature of the destructive agent
• Human error
• Time of occurrence
• Lack of opportunity for effective action
• Degree of uncertainty
• Properties of the post-disaster and duration of threat
• Environment (temperature, humidity, pollution...)
Host Related Factors
Although specific factors intensify reactions, there are personal risk factors that people often possess prior to the disaster/emergency that make them more vulnerable to disaster-precipitated stress. People often have preexisting stress prior to the disaster/emergency. This stress makes them more vulnerable to the challenges that a disaster/emergency situation brings.
Health
• Disabled: physical, sight, hearing, speech 91

• Health and medical problems, receiving medication Social
• Lack of support networks, divorced, widowed
• Cultural: language barriers, norms and fears about receiving
help in dealing with the system
Demographic
• Age: younger and older have more difficulties
• Sex: women report more stress than men but little differences have been found in immune and endocrine
responses
Past History
• Past disaster experience/traumatic events
• Past mental illness or emotional problems
3.4. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF DISASTER
3.4.1. Sexual violence
Rape is increasingly recognized as a feature of internal wars, but it could as well be experienced in many different types of conflicts. In some conflicts, rape has been used systematically as an attempt to undermine the opposing groups. Rape, sexual violence, and 92

exploitation may also be widespread in refugee camps, although the extent of its recognition is limited, widely varying estimates of the numbers of victims have been reported.
In addition to the long-lasting mental health disorders, rapes have resulted in the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). War and political conflict present high risk situations for the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HIV. There are various ways in which war predisposes to STI and HIV transmission, such as:
 widespread population movement, causing increased crowding;
 separation of women from partners normally providing protection;
 abuses and sexual demands by military personnel and others in positions of power;
 Weakened social structures, there by reducing inhibitions on aggressive behavior and violence against women.
Aside from these additional exposures, access to barrier contraceptives, to treatment for STIs, to the prerequisites for maintaining personal hygiene, and to health promotion advice are all compromised in conflict situations.
Human right violations:
93

Violations of human rights law and international humanitarian law that targets individuals can take many forms such as torture of civilian, physical and psychological harms to individuals do not end with the cessation of hostilities, sex trafficking, child labour, denying basic needs, etc.
The impact of disaster will also include indirect causes, such as food scarcity, population displacement, destruction of health facilities, and disruption of routine curative and preventive services.
3.4.2. Population Displacement
Population displacement due to environmental degradation is not a recent phenomenon. Historically, people have had to move from their land because it had been degraded (through natural disasters, war or over-exploitation) and could not sustain them. What is more recent is the potential for mass movements caused by population growth, resource depletion and the irreversible destruction of the environment. Environmental disasters such as floods, droughts and earthquakes are displacing more and more people every year. People and governments of many nations are altering the physical environment in a way that makes it more vulnerable to disruption. For example, rapid rates of population growth and high levels of consumption in affluent states have resulted in the overutilisation and degradation of the land. As deforestation, desertification, global warming, and other threats appear, a new category of displaced people is being recognized - the environmentally displaced.
94

Mass population movement is due primarily to war, famine, drought or combination of these factors. Such migration predisposes large number to overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, malnutrition, and diseases for which they may not be immune. The highest morbidity and mortality rates occur in the mass displacements of populations in areas of limited resources during the acute phase of disaster. Measles, diarrheal illness (eg. cholera) and acute upper respiratory infection have emerged as the most common causes of infectious diseases – related deaths among refuge and internally displaced populations in 1990s. For example, Somalia and Rwanda provide the most devastating large scale mortality rates from infectious diseases in mass population displacements. In such situations, the crude death is inevitably higher in the refugee population than the base crude death rate of the host population.
In general, the variety of possible situations displaced persons may be experienced, in varying degrees, are summarized as follows:
 Loss of means of livelihood;
 Communities becoming separated from any
services
previously provided;
 Loss of normal sources of food;
 Lack of shelter and household necessities;
 Lack of fuel for cooking;
 Lack of potable water;
 Communicable diseases and overcrowding;
 Additional burdens particularly for women heads of
households;
95

 Possibly large numbers of unaccompanied children;  Loss of land tenure;
 Possible communication and logistics problems;
 Insecurity due to tension and military activities.
3.4.3. Communicable diseases
In general, the risks of large scale epidemics are low immediately following acute natural disasters, particularly in the developed world.
o Infectious disease outbreaks usually occur in the post impact and recovery phases and not during the acute phase. o The risks of epidemics increase; however, if drought,
famine, and large displacements of people are involved. These risks will be minimized if potable water; safe food; sanitation services including human and animal wastes removal; adequate personal hygiene; vector control; maintenance of routine immunization programs; sufficient space and ventilation in shelters and temporary housing; and the isolation of patients with communicable diseases are provided.
3.4.4. Climatic exposure
To a large extent, public health depends on safe drinking water, sufficient food, secure shelter, and good social conditions. A changing climate is likely to affect all of these conditions. Overall, however, the health effects of a rapidly changing climate are likely to be overwhelmingly negative, particularly in the poorest communities,
96

which have contributed least to greenhouse gas emissions. Marked and short-term fluctuations in weather can cause acute adverse health effects; including the following:
• Extremes of both heat and cold can cause potentially fatal illnesses, e.g. heat stress or hypothermia, as well as increasing death rates from heart and respiratory diseases.
• In cities, stagnant weather conditions can trap both warm air and air pollutants -- leading to smog episodes with significant health impacts.
• These effects can be significant. For example abnormally high temperatures in Europe in the summer of 2003 were associated with at least 27,000 more deaths than the equivalent period in previous years.
Other weather extremes, such as heavy rains, floods, and hurricanes, also have severe impacts on health. Approximately 600,000 deaths occurred world-wide as a result of weather-related natural disasters in the 1990s; and some 95% of these were in poor countries.
• In October 1999, a cyclone in Orissa, India, caused 10,000 deaths. The total number of people affected was estimated at 10-15 million;
• In December 1999, floods in and around Caracas, Venezuela, killed approximately 30,000 people, many in shanty towns on exposed slopes.
97

Measurement of health effects from climate change can only be very approximate. Nevertheless, a WHO quantitative assessment, taking into account only a subset of the possible health impacts, concluded that the effects of the climate change that has occurred since the mid-1970s may have caused over 150,000 deaths in 2000. It also concluded that these impacts are likely to increase in the future.
3.4.5. Food shortage and malnutrition
Famine and decreased per-capita food production in general can result from natural disasters (e.g. extensive flooding, prolonged drought, or gradual change in climate) or armed conflicts. In fact, in conflict areas food procurement and distribution have been used as a weapon of war. In Africa, drought permanently threatens 460 million people (see figure 5 below).

with a disaster will suffer to some degree from the emotional trauma. Human-created disasters seem to cause a more intense reaction than those of natural occurrence. The most consistent positive predictor of significant symptoms is the degree of direct involvement in the disaster.
Risk factors for post traumatic stress disorder development after disaster:
 intense exposure to death and injury;
 exposure of survivors to dead bodies;
 overwhelming life threatening danger;
 unexpected or first exposure to disaster;  intense initial phase (prolonged stress);  manmade disaster with no warning;
 high impact ratios;
 dependence on outside agencies;  exposure to prolonged stress.
Time course of post traumatic stress disorder:
The development of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be delayed from one week to three years, and it is divided into three stages.
• Stage one is associated with an adrenergic surge that occurs acutely, but persons rarely dwell long term on the incident. It may last up to one month, and, if symptoms last
100

more than six weeks, the patients are considered to have
been entered stage two.
• Stage two is characterized by a sense of helplessness and
a loss of self-control. Autonomic and somatic manifestations dominate. Moreover, it is accompanied by lifestyle and personality changes.
• Stage three is characterized by profound despondency and demoralization.
Prognosis:
Overall, the majority (70% to 90%) of the patients with PTSD will do well: 30% rapidly, 40 % manifest mild symptoms, 20% manifest moderate symptoms, 10% don’t recover or get worse. Patients with a good prognosis are those with a rapid onset and a short duration of symptoms. These people usually have strong social net work, and usually they have participated in one form of formal process of trying to resolve the emotional content of an incident in order to prevent PTSD.
3.4.6.1. Children in disasters:
The actual degree of emotional trauma among children is usually underestimated after disaster. The most important reasons for this are:
 Most studies to date have had significant methodological flaws.
101

 Parents are either unaware or unwilling to admit any inability to protect their children from stress, and therefore they under report it.
 The extrapolation of emotional status from non-disaster events to disaster may also give false evaluation of the level of the symptoms in children.
 Most of the childhood emotional effects of disaster are age- related.
The impact of disaster on children should be thought of in terms of their developmental age and not their chronologic age. Preschoolers are still exercising some normal separation anxiety. Disaster will increase the normal feelings. Increased arousal, sleep disturbances, clinging and fear of being alone all become manifest. School-age children tend to be less dependent on their parents. As such their response to the stress of a disaster may be less consistent. They may exhibit reckless behavior and may experience psychosomatic complaints. Adolescents, who are independent, often become involved in productive activities, such as rescue and recovery work. Some; however, may regress and may display withdrawn functioning under significant denial. Normal adolescent anxiety may be increased particularly if they identify with the victims.
Risk factors of an increased emotional trauma in children:
 high intensity event;
 injury to the child;
 loss of parent or significant person;
102

 fear of death, separation and recurrence of the disaster;  insecurity, lack of support;
3.4.6.2. The elderly in disasters:
The elderly are indeed at an increased risk for physical injury in some circumstances, but they are not necessarily at an increased risk for psycho emotional disorder. However, the impact of the loss of spouse, relative, or even a pet may be greater in the elderly. Another factor is the loss of self-reliance. In some cases the disruption of normal routines and living environment may result in confusion and aberrant behavior. However, the life experience of the elderly may be a valuable resource during the recovery phase of the disaster. They often have more realistic expectations of what their recovery needs are.
Treatment:
Mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, and psychologists, are regarded as the principal providers of care to the PTSD patients. Psychotherapy and behavioral therapy are generally thought necessary, and they have yielded good results, in addition, some patients may benefit from psychotropic medications.
3.4.6.3. Rescue workers in disaster:
The most common secondary victims of a disaster are those providing care to the victims. These include not only rescue and search personnel but also physicians, nurses and other staff. The
103

stress reactions seen in non-professionals involved in disaster response resemble the symptoms seen in primary victims. Many professional responders also report serious symptoms following disaster. Rescue workers will have more intense emotional trauma if they are involved in a failed rescue attempts (especially if children are involved). However, up to 90% of the professionals involved will have good coping skills.
The most serious reactions occur among rescue workers involved with body handling. These are due to in part the profound sensory stimulation experienced by these personnel. Inexperienced body handlers have significantly more symptoms than those with previous experience. Symptoms can also be correlated with number of bodies encountered by the rescue worker
Additional symptoms of PTSD in professional disaster worker are decreased by:
 ability to judge risk;
 leadership ability;
 efficiency;
 ability to work cooperatively.
Factors for decreasing PTSD symptoms in disaster workers are:
 prior disaster training;
 specific disaster education;
104

 maturity;
 experience with prior disasters;
 Leadership type (good leadership).
Coping methods for disaster recovery workers include:
 To avoid humanization of the bodies;
 not to look at the faces;
 not to learn the name of the victims;
 to concentrate on the tasks at hand;
 to concentrate on the benefit to the society.
In disaster people loose loved ones, relatives and property. Above all, in psychological terms, they lose faith – not religious faith, but faith in the fact that life has a certain consistency and meaning.
3.4.7. Five experiences borne by survivors are:
• The death imprint: it consists of indelible imaginary of the encounter with death, intruding whilst awake, or during sleep in the form of nightmares. It comprises considerations of experience - images of the impact such as the sight of bodies dismembered or crushed, the sounds of screaming, or the smell of burning flesh.
• Survivor guilt: when the person questions why they survived when other did not, can be of two sorts:
105

o There is what might be called “existential guilt”. Here, the person dwells in a very general way on their survival – ‘why me?’ or ‘why did God choose me?’ perhaps, ‘why me when I am old and so many children died?’
o Guilt may be focused on actions or their absence – ‘Did I do enough, could I have saved more people? Guilt may be especially intense when parents survive their children, or where there is competition for survival.
• Psychic numbing: it is manoeuvre, presenting survivors from experiencing the reality of the catastrophic destruction and death about them, and the massive personal threat implied.
o It blocks the experience of too much unbearable pain at any time, and its first manifestations are present in the so called ‘disaster syndrome’, where immediately following the impact, behaving remarkable calmly.
o They may seem to be in control and coping bravely – in fact, they have not yet to react. They are behaving as though they are calm observers of someone else’s experience.
• Nurturance conflicts: refers to suspicion of offers from outsiders and in particular to the experience of distrust, the fear that such offers may be false.
106

o Survivors may become ‘touchy and sensitive to the response of others’.
o Develop ‘a form of severe victim-consciousness’ which sometimes reaches the level of paranoia.
• Quest for meaning: the survivors need to make a ‘formulation’ of their experience in the attempt to explain and gain mastery over it. Formulation is a key element of psychological processing and hence of much psychological treatment of trauma. The survivors’ search to understand the experience of the disaster exists on a number of levels, which might be termed as ‘hierarchy of formulation’. In terms of development of understanding over time, a psychological sequence might be:
Mutual assistance and disaster intervention programs may significantly limit the impact of disaster on the community. International assistance is difficult to manage and coordinate but may make a decisive difference in the outcome, especially in countries and areas with very limited resources.
3.5. Development and Disasters
For a long time the cause and effect relationship between disasters and social and economic development was ignored. Development planners hoped that disasters would not occur and, if they did, were most effectively handled by relief from donor countries and relief organizations. Disasters were seen in the context of emergency
107

response-not as a part of long term development programming. When a disaster did occur, the response was directed to emergency needs and cleaning up.
The growing body of knowledge on the relationships between disasters and development indicates four basic themes. The themes may be expanded as follows:
 Disasters set back development programming, destroying years of development initiatives.
 Rebuilding after a disaster provides significant opportunities to initiate development programs.
 Development programs can increase a particular area's susceptibility to disasters. A major increase in livestock development leads to overgrazing, which contributes to desertification and increased vulnerability to famine.
 Development programs can be designed to decrease susceptibility to disasters and their negative consequences. Housing projects constructed under building codes designed to withstand high winds result in less destruction during the next tropical storm.
3.5.1 Disruption of Development by Disasters:
Disasters can seriously disrupt development initiatives in several
ways, including:
• Loss of resources
• Interruption of programs
108

• Impact on investment
• Impact on the non-formal sector
• Political destabilization
Loss of Resources: Development resources are lost when a disaster wipes out the products of investment. It shortens the life of development investments.
Interruption of Programs: Disasters interrupt ongoing programs and divert resources from originally planned uses.
Impact on Investment Climate: Investors need a climate of stability and certainty to be encouraged not to risk their money.
Impact on Non-Formal Sector: Disasters depress the non-formal economy through the direct costs of lost equipment and housing (which often also serves as business sites). The indirect costs of disasters include lost employment, and lost income. Sometimes the importation of relief items creates disincentives to producers.
Political Destabilization: The stress to a country caused by a disaster often results in the destabilization of the government. This may occur for several reasons. For example, mismanagement of the disaster relief and recovery, or the survivors may have had unmet expectations.
109

3.5.2 How Development May Cause Disasters
Development projects implemented without taking into account existing environmental hazards may increase vulnerability to natural disasters. For example, projects designed to increase employment opportunities, and thus income, usually attract additional population growth. Low-income people may then have to seek housing in areas previously avoided, on hillsides or in floodplains. The cost of relief assistance after a landslide or flood can easily outweigh the benefits to the economy of more jobs. Similarly, development projects may lead to negative political consequences that increase the vulnerability to civil conflict.
3.5.3 Development opportunities afforded by disasters
Disaster can serve as a catalyst for introducing mitigation activities. Disasters often create a political and economic atmosphere wherein extensive changes can be made more rapidly than under normal circumstances. For example, in the aftermath of a disaster, there may be major opportunities to execute land reform programs, to improve the overall housing stock, to create new jobs and job skills, and to expand and modernize the economic base of the community - opportunities that would not otherwise be possible.
Disasters can also highlight high-risk areas where action must be taken before another disaster strikes. The realization of vulnerability can motivate policy-makers and the public to participate in mitigation activities. Disasters may also serve to highlight the fact that the
110

country is seriously under-developed. They can thus bring in funding and the attention of donor communities to apply to long-term development needs (Henderson, 1990).

CHAPTER FOUR DISASTER MANAGEMENT
Learning Objectives:
At the end of this chapter students will be able to:
 Define disaster preparedness
 Discuss different risk reduction measures
 Define disaster response, disaster mitigation and disaster
recovery
 Explain disaster mitigation strategies
4.1 Introduction
The scope of disaster management can include all disaster-related activities. These activities are categorized as disaster preparedness, disaster response, disaster recovery, post disaster epidemiological surveillance, environmental management and disaster mitigation. The details of these activities are treated in the subsequent sections of this chapter.
Aims of disaster management are to:
 Reduce (avoid, if possible) the potential losses from hazards;
 Assure prompt and appropriate assistance to victims when necessary;
 Achieve rapid and durable recovery. 113

4.2 Disaster preparedness
Disaster preparedness is defined as a state of readiness to respond to a disaster, crisis, or any other type of emergency situation. More broadly it is stated as the leadership, training, readiness and exercise support, and technical and financial assistance to strengthen citizens, communities, state, local and tribal governments professional emergency workers as they prepare for disaster, mitigate the effects of disaster, respond to community needs after a disaster, and launch effective recovery efforts (www.fema.gov).
All measures and policies taken before an event occurs that allow for prevention, mitigation, and readiness constitutes disaster preparedness. Preparedness includes designing warning systems, planning for evacuation, and reallocation, storing food and water, building temporary shelters, devising management strategies, and holding disaster drills and exercises,. Contingency planning is also included in preparedness as well as planning for post-impact response and recovery.
The aim of disaster preparation is to be able to reduce the immediate mortality and morbidity with a better prepared, well equipped service. The preparation includes early warning systems for seasonal changes in climate, and risk of flood or drought, such as electronic information systems and satellites that can provide information over large regions and continents. Separate systems are needed to cater for the agricultural sector, cities and people in rural
114

or remote communities. The public health infrastructure is particularly important for the immediate measures needed and for public information on reducing the health risks.
The most important challenge is to change from concentrating solely on post-disaster relief and to focus on pre-disaster preparedness. Thanks to disaster-preparedness schemes, particularly to an increasingly sophisticated early warning system, the comparative losses of life due to weather-related disasters are declining. All the evidence shows that, for every dollar spent on prevention and preparedness, about $100 or more is needed for relief efforts after the disaster has taken place.
Where such forecasting and warning systems are installed as part of disaster-management programs, evidence shows that more lives can be saved and damage is drastically reduced
Being prepared also means having thorough disaster contingency plans comprising of:
• Covering emergency housing, repairs, replacement of essential equipment and protection of the most vulnerable people in the community: the sick, the very young and the old.
• Improvement of water supply and sanitation systems
115

• Logistics of the predicted need for health and social services need to be laid down in advance, including early warning systems to detect health effects.
• Planning for climate change: as global warming and its effects on water will increase the frequency of water related disasters.
• Public information and education: to ensure early warnings to communities at risk; and give information about how to conserve water and keep it safe from contamination.
Preparedness
training to the plan, and exercising the plan. Preparedness deals with the functional aspects of emergency management such as the response to and recovery from a disaster, whereas mitigation attempts to lessen these effects through pre-disaster actions as simple as striving to create “disaster-resistant” communities.
Planning for various disasters:
Two strategies for disaster planning include the agent-specific and the all-hazards approaches. In agent-specific planning, communities only plan for threats most likely to occur in their region. Since many disasters pose similar problems and similar tasks, an all-hazards approach involves planning for the common problems and tasks that arise in the majority of disasters.
116
consists of three basic steps: preparing a plan,

 Figure 8 Phases of Disaster Management
117

The following are some of the means to plan for disastrous situations:
• Escape routes
• Family communications
• Utility shut-off and safety
• Insurance and vital records
• Special needs
• Safety Skills
Escape Routes
Identify and prepare escape routes such as alternative doors, windows, and path ways.
Family Communications
It is important to contact police departments, Red-Cross, radio/Television (media) stations to find family members. Pick also a friend or relative who lives out-of- woredas, zone, and region for household members to notify that they are safe.
Utility Shut-off and Safety
In the event of a disaster, you may be instructed to shut off the utility service at your home. Below is some general guidance for shutting off utility service:
118

Natural Gas: Natural gas leaks and explosions are responsible for a significant number of fires following disasters. It is vital that all household members (who have natural gas) know how to shut off natural gas.
Water: Water quickly becomes a precious resource following many disasters. It is vital that all household members (who have water pipe lie) learn how to shut off the water at the main house valve.
• Cracked lines may pollute the water supply to your house. It is wise to shut off your water until you hear from authorities that it is safe for drinking.
Electricity: Electrical sparks have the potential of igniting natural gas if it is leaking. It is wise to teach all responsible household members where and how to shut off the electricity.
Preparing to Shut Off Electricity
• Locate your electricity circuit box.
• Teach all responsible household members how to shut off
the electricity to the entire house.
For Your Safety: always shut off all the individual circuits before shutting off the main circuit breaker.
119

Insurance and vital records:
Households should be encouraged to have insurance for property, health and life. Such vital records, including insurance, bank... books need to be kept in safe place.
Planning for Special Needs
If you have special needs, find out about special assistance that may be available in your community.
• Create a network of neighbors, relatives, friends, and coworkers to aid you in an emergency. Discuss your needs and make sure everyone knows how to operate necessary equipment.
• Discuss your needs with your employer.
• If you are mobility impaired and live or work in a high-rise
building, have an escape chair.
• If you live in an apartment building, ask the management to
mark accessible exits clearly and to make arrangements to
help you leave the building.
• Keep specialized items ready, including extra wheelchair
batteries, oxygen, catheters, medication, food for service
animals, and any other items you might need.
• Be sure to make provisions for medications that require
refrigeration.
• Keep a list of the type and model numbers of the medical
devices you require.
120

Additionally, under each specific disaster, the necessary preparedness to be made is discussed accordingly and readers are advised to refer to chapter two for more information regarding specific disaster.
4.3 Disaster Response
Response is the immediate reaction to disaster. It may occur as the disaster is anticipated, as well as soon after it begins. Examples include mass evacuation, sandbagging buildings and other structures, securing emergency food and water, covering windows, providing emergency medical services, search and rescue, firefighting, and restoring public order to prevent looting.
Extrication, triage, stabilization, and transport
Extrication has evolved into a fire services function in most of the country. In addition to specialized technical and trench rescue teams, fire services have more experience with building collapse and secondary hazards (eg, floods, fires) than other organizations.
The concept of triage involves providing the most help for as many as possible. Medical personnel are accustomed to providing extensive, definitive care to every patient. When confronted by a number of patients simultaneously in a disaster situation, it is easy to become overwhelmed, even for an experienced disaster worker. Triage must occur at multiple levels, and patients must be reassessed during every step of the process.
121

Transport must be both organized and orchestrated.
Definitive scene management
While scene control and containment may be relatively simple in a local, static disaster, dynamic and paralytic disasters may take several days to contain and stabilize. As the length of time of the disaster increases, additional resources must be made available, as rescue crews reach exhaustion, supplies become spent, and additional hazards develop.
There is often theoretical debate over when the response function ends and recovery function begins. For the time being, the response function is classified as the immediate actions to save lives, protect properties, and meet basic human needs.
Activation
Notification and initial response: During this phase, organizations involved in disaster response and the potentially affected populations are notified.
Organization of command and scene assessment: The prearranged command and staff structure for responding to the disaster should be arranged and initial communications nets established.
122

Emergency Response Activities:
Emergency response activities are those carried out during the actual emergency or immediately prior to it. This may involve evacuation of threatened communities, emergency assistance during the disaster, and actions taken in the immediate aftermath during the time when the community is rather disorganized and basic services and infrastructure are not fully functioning. Because the emergency period is both dramatic and traumatic, most attention by the press and international community is focused here. Yet in most disasters (with the exception of droughts and civil strife), the emergency passes rather quickly and, in reality, only accounts for a very small percentage of the total picture.
Twelve tasks or problems are likely to occur in most disasters are summarized below:
 Interorganizational coordination is important.
 Sharing information among organizations,
 Resource management,
 When advance warnings are possible, evaluations from
areas of danger can be the most effective life-saving
strategy in disaster.
 The public tends to underestimate risks and downplays
warnings if messages are ambiguous or inconsistent.
 Search and rescue
 Using the mass media: to deliver warnings to the public and
to educate the public
123

 Triage: is a method of assigning priority for treatment and transport for injured citizens.
 Casualty distribution: in most domestic disasters, several medical resources can handle the casualty distribution.
 Patient tracking: is complicated by the fact that most persons evacuating their homes do not seek lodging in public shelters where their presence will be registered.
 Caring for patients when the health care infrastructure has been damaged requires careful advance planning.
 The management of volunteers and donations: is a common problem in disasters. Procedures should be established to manage large number of resources.
 Plan for organized improvement in response to the disruption of shelter, utilities, communication systems, and transportation.
4.4. Declaration of disaster:
The social disorganization surrounding a disaster and the number and types of responding organizations and groups create the need for a well-ordered mass response system. Consequently, a complex organizational environment has to be developed to respond in disaster situations. To mobilize these organizations, a declaration of disaster is initiated according to an increasing level of emergency (disaster).
Disaster shall be declared when convincing and complete socio- economic reports from regional councils and the National Early
124

Warning System are provided. National level declaration for disaster will be made only by the National Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Committee (NDPPC). The commencement of relief measures shall automatically follow the declaration of disaster in the area. However, it is not always necessary to wait such formal declaration, or NDPPC’s decisions on measures to be taken. Having regard to the policies of the Government, relief operation may commence with the available local resource before a formal declaration if the state of distress warrants immediate intervention. Subject to its enforcement by NDPPC and depending on the context of the disaster, the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) may also authorize certain essential measures to be taken in such situations.
4.5. Disaster Recovery (Rehabilitation and Reconstruction):
The primary aim of recovery is to assist the affected community to regain a proper level of functioning following a disaster both initially and in the long term. It is “the coordinated process of supporting emergency-affected communities in reconstruction of the physical infrastructure and restoration of emotional, social, and physical well- being” (Emergency Management Australia, 2004). Recovery essentially concerns rehabilitation as well as developing the tools to mitigate against the future impact of a disaster, and should return the community to an improved state of post-disaster. This includes those activities that continue beyond the emergency period to restore lifelines. Examples include providing temporary shelters, restoring power, critical stress debriefing for emergency responders
125

and victims, job assistance, small business loans, and debris clearance.
Recovery involves decisions and actions relative to rebuilding homes, replacing property, resuming employment, restoring business, and permanently repairing and rebuilding infrastructures. Since the recovery function has such long-lasting effects and usually high costs, the participants in the process are numerous. They include all levels of government, the business community, political leadership, community activists and individuals.
The recovery phase is frequently underemphasized in disaster plans, but it is crucial for the affected community. Recovery efforts should identify opportunities for community development, especially in terms of creating sustainable, safer, and more resilient communities.
The four elements of recovery are:
1. Community recovery (including psychological recovery);
2. Infrastructure recovery (services and lifelines);
3. Economy recovery (including financial and political
considerations, and business continuity);
4. Environment recovery.
126

1. Community recovery:
 Have we considered the specific needs of our community? That is, the cultures, traditions, demographics, etc as identified.
 What mechanisms and resources will be required to aid in the psychological recovery of the community?
 What financial assistance is available to the community? For example, government payments and public appeals.
 What government and non-government agencies would you consider necessary to rebuild your community following disaster?
 What are likely to be the medical and health requirements of the community?
2. Infrastructure recovery:
 How will we ensure the restoration of essential services?
 How will our community access essential services?
 How will we ensure or facilitate restoration of living
conditions and housing security?
 How will we rebuild our community infrastructure? This
includes ports, airports, dry storage, roads, public transport, fuel, gas, water, electricity, telecommunications, garbage and sewerage, waterways, parks, flora and fauna.
 How will we communicate with our community and external agencies? This includes gathering, processing and
127

circulating information to and from the community. It also encompasses communication with disaster workers (staff and volunteers), media, local government management, suppliers, groups and authorities including the local disaster management group.
 Are our recovery plans adequately integrated and/or considerate of plans of other relevant services (such as health, energy, telecommunications, etc)?
3. Economic recovery:
 What impact will disaster have on job security in our community? (that is, both for displaced community members and volunteers in the recovery process.)
 What mechanisms and resources will be required to assist and ensure the economic recovery of the community?
 Who needs to be involved in re-establishing economic validity in our community?
4. Environmental recovery:
 What issues do we need to consider in preparing for and managing environmental damage caused by a disaster event?
 Who needs to be involved in this process?
128

Principles of disaster recovery and reconstruction:
Three phases describe as to what happens to post-impact in the affected community:
1. Emergency phase: activities should focus on saving lives through search and rescue, first aid, emergency medical assistance and over all disaster assessment. Efforts immediately begin to repair critical facilities, to restore communications, and transportation networks, and in some cases, to evacuate residents from areas still vulnerable to further disaster.
2. Transition or recovery phase: during this phase, people return to work, repair damaged buildings and infrastructure, and initiate other actions that allow the community to return to their normal as soon as possible. Victims begin emotional recovery and may experience depression and post-traumatic disorder.
3. Reconstruction phase: is characterized by physical reordering of communications, utilities, roads and general environment. Residents repair or rebuild their housing and agricultural activities resume.
Community participation is essential for planning the rehabilitation phase because local people better understand their own needs and the problems that create these needs.
129

4.6 Disaster mitigation
Mitigation is defined as a sustained action to reduce or eliminate risk to people and property from hazards (disasters) and their effects. The function of mitigation differs from other emergency management disciplines since it looks at long-term solutions to reduce risk as opposed to preparedness for hazards, the immediate response to hazards, or the short-term recovery from a hazard event.
Disaster mitigation includes those activities designed to prevent or reduce losses from disaster. It is usually considered the initial phase of emergency management, although it may be a component in the other phases. Examples include land-use planning, to limit or prevent development in floodplains, building codes to reduce losses from earthquakes and fires, dam and levees to prevent flooding.
The mitigation efforts must include:
• Emergency housing, especially after floods, but also if drought has caused mass population movement in an attempt to find better water and food supplies.
• Provision of emergency supplies of safe drinking water.
• Emergency repairs to homes, drains and water supply and
sanitation infrastructure.
130

• Early warning systems to identify health effects and to detect rise in mosquito borne diseases, such as malaria, and diarrheal diseases, such as cholera.
Both disaster preparedness and its mitigation require multisectoral cooperation and joint planning. Both need evaluation after a disaster to reduce the ill effects of later crises.
The goal of mitigation is to create economically secure, socially stable, better built, and more environmentally sound communities that are out of harm’s ways. The following widely accepted tools are used to reduce risks:
 Hazard identification and mapping,  Design and construction applications  Land-use planning,
 Finical incentives,
 Insurance,
 Structural controls.
In certain cases, some of the devastating effects of disasters can be reduced before the actual event. For example, evacuations may be orchestrated before hurricanes or floods. Early warning allows residents to seek shelter from tornadoes.
131

Disaster Mitigation Strategies
Risk Identification
To reduce the threat of droughts and to lessen their impact should they occur, a number of measures can be taken. The first step in disaster mitigation is to identify areas that are at risk to drought. Once the priority zones have been identified, comprehensive and integrated rural development programs should be initiated. Among the usual activities are:
• Agricultural improvements including modifying cropping patterns and introduction of drought-resistant varieties of crops;
• Rangeland management including improvement of grazing lands, and grazing patterns, introduction of feedlots, and protection of shrubs and trees.
• Water resource development including improved irrigation, and water storage facilities, protection of surface water from evaporation, introduction of drip irrigation systems, and water containment methods such as retention dams and subsurface dams.
Animal husbandry activities including maintaining smaller herds, eliminating unproductive animals, and upgrading the quality and productivity of stock through improved breeding practices.
132

Land-Use Planning
Another approach to reduce the impact of droughts on human settlements (including nomadic communities) is to employ land-use planning techniques.
Land-use controls similar to zoning regulations could be created and adopted by governing bodies. These controls can include:
• numbers of livestock per unit area;
• maximum population density;
• limits on amounts of water taken from public water supplies
for agricultural or industrial use;
• authority to declare a state of emergency during which time
animal herds are required to be depleted or transported to non-emergency areas, more stringent water usage allowances are imposed, etc.
Impediments to Mitigations
There are several factors, including denial of the risk, political will, cost and lack of funding.
4.7. Post disaster epidemiological surveillance:
Post-impact needs assessment provides information necessary to begin recovery. The first step is to assess community capacities and vulnerabilities, including physical environment (i.e. intact infrastructure, resources), social conditions (i.e. existing
133

organizations, support, networks), and population attitude towards and motivation to recover. Communication must be established between the people affected by the disaster and the responding jurisdictions and organizations. Needs are determined by visiting representative areas, by talking to selected groups in affected communities, and by conducting rapid health assessment surveys.
Principles of the undertaking are to:
 Maximize use of pre-existing surveillance data for "baseline" information, and to modify conditions
 Coordinate efforts after disaster with the normal surveillance activities in the health sector.
 Avoid duplication of efforts
 Be familiar with the epidemiology of endemic diseases and
with the national surveillance system.
 Coordinate the relief surveillance of communicable disease
with activities of national health authorities.
 Strengthen the reporting systems.
 Strengthen the documentation system at the central level, in
hospitals and clinics at the intermediate level.
Steps in Epidemiologic Surveillance that should be taken before and after a Rapid-Onset Disaster
1. Identification of the diseases and other conditions to be monitored, and selection of suitable indicators.
2. Delineation of the areas affected by the disaster.
134

3. Rapid statistical sampling of sites (ideally including unaffected localities for control purposes).
4. Rapid, gross detection of cases or presumptive cases based on the presence of a symptom or complaint.
5. Monitoring and reporting by local health services of the selected diseases or symptoms.
6. Interpretation of data at the national level by a health unit of the disaster-affected country that is experienced in data analysis and has direct access to relief authorities.
7. Investigation of any "unusual" occurrence of disease by local health workers, assisted when necessary by epidemiologists.
Requirements
For surveillance to be most effective, there are four requirements.
1. Establishment of priorities for investigating unusual occurrences of diseases, whether confirmed or rumored.
2. Establishment of a mechanism for dissemination of
surveillance information to both encourage taking of appropriate measures and discourage expenditure on inappropriate measures.
3. Training and involvement of local health workers at all levels of the health system.
4. Pre-disaster planning, including identification of real health risks in various disaster situations, assignment of
135

responsibilities, and development of an assessment and surveillance plan.
The Collection, Interpretation and Utilization of Data
Participation of field health units in the surveillance system must be as complete as possible after a disaster. It is critical to motivate reporting units. The participation of units operating before the disaster should be continued when possible, with emphasis in reporting placed upon the diseases or symptom complexes targeted for surveillance. Health teams mobilized for the relief effort should be adequately briefed about the importance of surveillance. They should be given the case definitions to be used (according to IDSR) and be amply provided supplies of reporting forms.
Two operational aspects of data collection deserve emphasis. First is the importance of regularly sending "negative" reports whenever no patients with notifiable diseases are seen in a unit. A report form with a line of zeros provides valuable information. It also permits assessment of the number of units participating in the surveillance system. Failure to report, on the other hand, can either mean a lack of disease, or that a unit has dropped out of the surveillance effort. Speed of reporting is always critical in communicable disease surveillance and is especially vital following disaster. In general, weekly reporting from all units by telephone, telegraph or shortwave radio is preferable to reporting by mail. Immediate consultation about any unusual condition or suspected epidemic, at any time during the week, should be encouraged.
136

Innovative ways to facilitate rapid reporting during the period of severe disruption in transportation and communication should be sought by members of the epidemiology unit. Egs include:
• Daily or weekly radio reporting of selected diseases from the field;
• The distribution and retrieval of reporting forms by members of the drug and/or food distribution system;
• Gaining access to the national security force's communication network;
• Incorporating disease surveillance into a more general regular report required by the relief coordinator;
• Regular visit to field units by the epidemiologist-in-charge or a member of the surveillance team.
It is important that incoming notifications are evaluated immediately upon receipt by the epidemiology unit to provide prompt response to rumors or enquiries
The epidemiologists should also develop maps and graphs for visual appreciation of disease trends. This is frequently a more productive investment of the scarce time of staff members than is generating columns and figures. Maps with pins indicating the geographic clustering of cases are particularly useful for following the spread of a disease. Well charted graphs can more sensitively indicate disease trends than numbers.
137

Providing Feedback to the Field from the Central Level
Providing feedback is an important aspect of post-disaster surveillance. The weekly report provides more than feedback to field workers. The epidemiologist should ensure that the weekly report and adequate background information (personal visit or covering note) are circulated to the relief coordinator and other national authorities and local representatives of voluntary agencies. The overall relief coordinator should be responsible for distributing the report to members of the media and the community.
Presenting Epidemiologic Information to Decision Makers
It is critical to present information from surveillance and the field investigations to key decision makers. Epidemiologic information, implications and an outline of alternatives of action must be summarized in non-technical terms understandable to lay people.
Surveillance During and After the Recovery Phase
With increasing passage of time after a disaster, both decision makers and the public become progressively less concerned with the probability of epidemic disease. The phasing out of the intensified, disaster-related surveillance activities should take place after consultation with members of the national epidemiology group.
138

4.8. Environmental health management
The impacts of disasters, whether natural or man-made, not only have human dimensions, but environmental ones as well. Environmental conditions may exacerbate the impact of a disaster, and vice versa, disasters have an impact on the environment. Deforestation, forest management practices, agriculture systems etc. can exacerbate the negative environmental impacts of a storm or typhoon, leading to landslides, flooding, silting and ground/surface water contamination.
Emphasizing and reinforcing the centrality of environmental concerns in disaster management has become a critical priority, requiring the sound management of natural resources as a tool to prevent disasters or lessen their impacts on people, their homes and livelihoods.
There is a clear need to reinforce the importance of environmental concerns in the entire disaster management cycle of prevention, preparedness, assessment, mitigation and response and to integrate environmental concerns into planning for relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and development. This will also require the enhancement of capacities to undertake short and medium-term activities in disaster management based on long-term environmental considerations.
Comprehensive understanding of natural systems coupled with the application of management tools such as environmental evaluation
139

and risk assessment can make a major contribution to a reduction of risks and mitigation of any impacts.
Specifically, we need to examine the need for a multi-stakeholder partnership that links local governments, private sector entities, and civil society organizations in order to facilitate more effective disaster prevention and mitigation.
Environment management is a critical strategy to prevent disasters, and reduce risks/vulnerabilities of disaster prone countries and communities. Disaster risks and vulnerability can be considerably reduced through effective and long-term environmental and natural resource management practices.

CHAPTER FIVE DISASTER IN ETHIOPIA
Learning objectives:
At the end of the chapter the students are expected to:
 Explain most prevailing disasters in Ethiopia.
 Describe parts of Ethiopia frequently affected by drought
and famine
5.1 Introduction:
There are different disasters that affect Ethiopia. The country has been drastically hit by and still is vulnerable to disasters due to various reasons such as low socio-economic development and hence inadequate action both to prevent and to respond to disasters. Among the frequent ones the following are worth mentioning: famine, drought, forced displacement (due to war, civil strives, political), floods, landslides, fires, epidemics (of human and animals), pests etc. Some of these will be discussed in detail as follows.
5.2. Drought and Famine
The most serious impact of droughts can be the initiation of famine. Its importance warrants an in depth discussion. It should be
142

regarded as a parallel disaster that will have parallel implications for preparedness, mitigation, and relief activities.
Drought affects more people than any other environmental hazard. Yet, it is perhaps the most complex and least understood type of all environmental hazards. Drought is often seen as too little rain and used to be synonymous with famine. However, fluctuation in rain fall does not cause a famine. Drought often triggers a crisis in the arid and semi-arid areas, since rain is sparse and irregular, but alone does not cause desertification. The ecosystem changes leading to desertification are all attributed to human activities, such as over cultivation, deforestation, overgrazing, and unskilled irrigation. Each of these activities is exacerbated by increasing human populations. The first three activities strip the soil of vegetation and deplete its organic substances and nutrient.
Famine is a disaster that occurs as the result of primarily drought, but it can also follow pestilence, windstorm, and human- induced catastrophes such as war and civil strife. Starvation is the result of food shortage. Famine and food emergencies are common events particularly in Africa, including Ethiopia and Asia, despite many intense and continuing efforts to address the problems. Drought- related famines appear to occur with cyclical frequency in many parts of Africa, both along the edges of deserts and in certain rain forest regions.
Famines rarely occur unexpectedly. Food stocks are not often depleted or destroyed suddenly and simultaneously in large
143

communities. More frequently, famine is predictable. In other words, the creeping onset of crop failure or food emergency is predictable from a series of meteorological, agricultural, political and/or economic indicators that may be monitored continuously. This process of famine preparedness through surveillance is a major function of the Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO) headquartered in Rome. Thus, it is extremely important that:
 indicators of an impending famine be closely monitored and measures taken quickly if it appears that a food shortage is developing;
 priority be given to developing strong food and agricultural systems that provide an adequate fall-back resource in threatened areas.
Regarding Ethiopia, most famines have concentrated geographically within two broad zones of the country. The first comprises of the central and northern high lands, stretching from northern previous Shewa through Wollo and Tigray. The second is made up of the crescent of low-lying, agro-pastoral lands ranging from Wollo in the north, through Hararge and Bale to Sidamo and Gamo-Gofa in the south. More than half of the crises of drought and famines have occurred in these two zones.
Ethiopia had previously suffered major drought and famine during the early 1970s. The late 1970s again brought signs of intensifying drought. By the early 1980s, large numbers of people in central Tigray, Wollo, and parts of Begemder (Gondar) and Shewa were beginning to feel the effects of renewed famine.
144

From 1982 to 1984, northern Ethiopia had no rain to water crops or for drinking. By mid-1984 it was evident that another drought and resulting famine of major proportions had begun to affect large parts of northern Ethiopia. The almost total failure of crops in the north was compounded by fighting in and around Eritrea, which hindered the passage of relief supplies. Although international relief organizations made a major effort to provide food to the affected areas, the persistence of drought and poor security conditions in the north resulted in continuing need as well as hazards for famine relief workers.
The 1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia was significant in the history of the country. Drought and political instability contributed to the severity of the famine, which was estimated to have killed over one million people and the remaining were destitute. The people were deprived of basic needs such as food, shelter, clothings, and medication. Many died as a result of starvation and from water- borne diseases.
Close to 8 million people became famine victims during the drought of 1984, and over 1 million died. In late 1985, another year of drought was forecasted, and by early 1986 the famine spread to parts of the southern highlands, with an estimated 5.8 million people being dependent on relief food. Exacerbating the problem in 1986 were locust plagues.
The primary Government response to the drought and famine was the decision to uproot large numbers of peasants who lived in
145

the affected areas in the north and to resettle them in the southern part of the country. In 1985 and 1986, about 600,000 people were moved, many forcibly, from their home villages and farms by the military and transported to various regions in the south. Many peasants fled rather than allow themselves to be resettled; many of those who were resettled sought later to return to their native regions. Several human rights organizations claimed that tens of thousands of peasants died as a result of forced resettlement.
Another government plan involved villagization, which was a response not only to the famine, but also to the poor security situation. Beginning in 1985, peasants were forced to move their homesteads into planned villages, which were clustered around water, schools, medical services, and utility supply points to facilitate distribution of those services. Many peasants fled rather than acquiesce in relocation, which in general proved highly unpopular. Additionally, the government in most cases failed to provide the promised services. Instead of benefiting agricultural productivity, the program caused a decline in food production. Although temporarily suspended in 1986, villagization was subsequently resumed.
In 2003, more than 12 million people were at risk of famine, half of whom being children under 15 years of age. Perhaps the most chilling aspect of this crisis was that the famine persists despite generous outside food aid. Donations of wheat, soyabeans and oil can stave off much of the starvation in the short term, but they cannot keep hunger from returning year after year.
146

Drought is the primary reason Ethiopians go hungry, but it intertwines with other factors that keep Ethiopians too poor and too sick to recover from drought years. Rural Ethiopians have never fully recovered from the famine of 1984, nor the severe droughts that have come after, especially in 1999 and 2000. The impact of drought in Ethiopia is magnified by the country's deforestation and the depletion of soil by farmers who cannot afford to let land lie fallow. The effects of dry periods linger long after the rains return.
Drought reduces harvests and deprives livestock of water and pasture, forcing farmers and animal herders into a spiral of debt. Even if the rains are good, each year Ethiopians get hungrier. The long-term issue is poverty - famine hits those too destitute to buy food or produce their own. Fighting famine inside Ethiopia means providing not only emergency food, but also programs to help people emerge from the trap of destitution. Rural Ethiopians need more markets for their crops and better roads to be able to move their products to other parts of the country. Famine is not a sudden event, but an evolving process, one that involves much more than food.
Traditionally the Economy of Ethiopia is based on subsistence agriculture... Due to a number of causes, the peasants did not have incentives to either improve production or to store their excess harvest. Despite the extensive modernization of Ethiopia in the last 120 years, as of 2005 the overwhelming majority of the populations are still peasants who live from harvest to harvest, and are vulnerable to crop failures.

Water shortages due to drought and war in Ethiopia
A long-term drought as well as the effects of civil war has afflicted the Somali Region of Ethiopia. The drought affected 8.3 million people of the region. Heavy rainfall in April 2000 brought some relief, but the continuing conflict has restricted efforts to sort out the water supplies and sanitation in the region. The aid program includes the installation of water reservoirs and digging or repairing wells. Emergency repairs have been conducted by UNICEF, associated with the distribution of water treatment chemicals and jerry cans throughout the hardest hit areas. ‘Donor fatigue’ and cynicism about the use of aid is a serious barrier to the international relief efforts to improve water supplies in the region.
Drought is related to climate and is relatively slow to develop. The primary public consequence of drought in developing countries, where food can’t be easily imported, is famine. In addition, drought and famine may cause extensive, long-lasting social tensions because they act to deepen poverty very suddenly and divide society between those who can afford to get food at any price and those who cannot. Drought and famine are also associated with large population movements that complicate the task of providing medical care, food, and water to the affected communities. Thus, the combination of drought and famine is one type of natural disaster
152

related to climate that has many of the worst characteristics of technological disasters. In general drought is characterized by the following features:
 A drought’s onset and end are difficult to determine because the effects accumulate slowly and may linger even after the apparent termination of an episode;
 The absence of precise and universally accepted definition adds to the confusion about whether a drought exists, and if it does, the degree of severity;
 Drought effects are less obvious and spread over a larger geographic area.
Disaster Preparedness for famine and drought
Several preparedness activities will decrease the impact of droughts on human settlements. Establishment of a monitoring system is very important. The first step in drought preparedness is to establish a monitoring system to provide warning if a drought is imminent. A monitoring system should be based on simple information that non- technical observers can easily acquire and transmit. Such a system is usually based on indicators. Among the normal indicators of the onset of drought are:
• an unusual dry period;
• an increased number of wind storms;
• an increased number of dust storms;
• diminishing water supplies;
153

• an increase in the death rate of animals;
• changes in the migratory patterns of nomads;
• reduced price of animals;
• changes in vegetation, especially the introduction of desert
plants such as scrub brushes;
• unusual changes in the prevalence rates of specific
communicable diseases associated with personal and environmental hygiene, principally non-venereal skin diseases and diarrheal diseases, indicating the diminished use of water for washing.
Identify and stockpile seeds for alternative drought-resistant crops. Once drought begins, some attempts must be made to stimulate alternative agricultural activities. A number of crops can survive mild droughts.
Identify and stockpile feeds for cattle or other livestock. Losses can be greatly reduced if herds are penned up and fed in feedlots. This will save the animals, take pressure off the land, and let vegetation regenerate.
Determine human nutritional requirements and develop an on-site relief distribution plan.
Identify and select appropriate action to fight desertification. If desertification is a potential threat, measures should be taken to identify suitable approaches that could be employed to prevent the creation of deserts during a drought period.
154

5.3. Floods
• Flooding due to outburst of banks of Awash River, and over flow from Koka reservoir led to displacement of 40,000 people in Wonji and Metehara in1996.
• Wabishebele river flooding affected 100,000 people in Somali region in 2003.
• 260,000 were displaced and 170 died due to flooding from Wabe Shabelle, Hargeysa, Bilate, Ashewa, Genale, Dawa, Fafen, Sile and Sego rivers in months of April and June 2005.
• The worst scenario of flood in Ethiopia occurred in the summer of 2006 as the result of prolonged and intensive rainfall which resulted in flash floods and overflow of rivers and dams affecting 199,900 people in eight regions of Ethiopia, resulting in loss of lives, damage of property, and destruction of livelihoods of tens of thousands of people. According to the government and humanitarian partner flash appeal of the year 2006 preliminary document, a total of 635 people have been died (364 in South Omo, 256 in Dire Dawa and 19 in other parts of the country).

            The effects and distribution of the 2006 floods are summarized as follows:
• Dire Dawa: the heavy rains from the high lands of East Hararge zone of Oromia regional State caused flash flood from the overflow of Dechatu dry season stream that severely affected Dire Dawa in the middle of the night on the six of August 2006, while residents were asleep where by it killed 256 and affected 9,000 people. It also washed away houses and properties of many people living along the riverbank. Roads, bridges and other properties were damaged and washed away. The estimate of over all loss of
157

damage of properties of individuals and infrastructure was
Eth Birr 27 million.
• South Nation and Nationalities People Region: over flow
of Omo River in August 2006 affected about 8,000 people in Desenech and Gnangatom districts of South Omo zone. It also killed 364 people and took away some 3,200 cattle and destroyed other properties, including 760 trditional stores. Furthermore, flash floods from Bilate River was reported to have affected 5370 households, in Humbo district, of Wolayta zone of which 2,515 were severely affected and required immediate emergency assistance.
• Amhara Region: overflow of Rib and Gomara Rivers and Lake Tana in Libo kemekem and Fogora districts of south Gondar, and Bahirdar town of west Gojam and flash floods in Dewchefa and Ansokia of Oromia and north –shewa zones respectively, displaced people from their residential places and forced about 13,362 people to stay under temporary shelters.
• West Shewa Zone of Oromia Region: flooding of the upper basin of Awash River affected 14 peasant associations in Illu, Sebeta Awaso, and Ejere districts of the zone. The flood affected a total of 14,790 people out of which 2052 people were displaced and forced to live in temporary shelters.
• Gambella Region: Overflow of Baro River affected crop fields of Gambella zuria, Jikawo, Itang, and Gillo distrcts.
158

• Somali Region: overflow of Wabishebele Riveraffected 3,000 people from Mustahil and 4,500 people from Kelafo districts; also it destroyed 650 hectare of farmland.
• Tigray Region: overflow of Tekeze Eiver in Kefta Humera of the Western Tigray zone displaced 450 households, destroyed houses and damaged crop fields.
According to the preliminary document, the overall resource needed to withstand the disaster, both for emergency relief and rehabilitation was estimated to be US$ 60,907,574 (33).
5.4. Earthquake:
At different times and in various places earthquakes have been noticed in Ethiopia. Some of the prominent earthquakes in the past 100 years are summarized below.

160

-In Damot Gale -625 hectares of crop land and 266 roofs were destroyed
5.6. Epidemics:
Ethiopia has been exposed to many epidemics of different magnitudes at different times in history. Among others, the following are worth mentioning
Meningitis:
The country lies in the Meningitis belt of Africa where the epidemics of the disease occur in cyclical fashion. And, hence, Meningitis epidemics have hit the country in 1935, 1940, 1950, 1964, 1981 and 1989; with 50,000 cases and 990 deaths in1981; and 45,806 cases and 1686 deaths in 1989 and later as well including Addis Ababa in the year 2000-2001.
Malaria:
Three-fourth of Ethiopian land area is malarious and about 68 % of the population is at risk of infection; therefore, the country is repeatedly affected by different waves of epidemics. For instance, in 1958, 3 million people were affected, and 150,000 died. Currently, averages of 400,000-600,000 cases with positive blood film for malaria are treated annually. Additionally three to four times of this figure are clinically treated at community level without blood film
161

examination. This condition is aggravated when compounded by other disasters due to migration to malarious areas, lowered immunity, changes in rain patterns, etc.
Cholera, Typhoid fever, Bloody Diarrhea, Louse-borne Relapsing fever, Measles and other communicable diseases are problems following other disasters due to low level of hygiene, shortage of potable water supply, overcrowding, pollution of water sources, malnutrition, etc. For example, occurrence of epidemics of suspected cholera was reported in the years: 1970, 1973 and 1985.
HIV/AIDS is among the diseases that prevail during and following disasters due to social instability. Sexual exploitation is common when social bondage is loosened as the victims have less protection. Hopelessness and detachment from parents (families) subject people to unprotected and unsafe sexual behaviors.

CHAPTER SIX
ROLE OF THE PRIMARY HEALTH CARE UNIT (PHCU) IN DISASTER MANAGEMENT
Learning objectives:
At the end of the chapter the students are expected to:
 Describe the roles and responsibilities of public health in both disaster preparedness and response.
 Organize the functional model of public health response to disasters.
6.1. Role of Primary Health Care Unit Team in the event of Disaster
The three main objectives of public health response to a disaster are to mitigate mortality and morbidity, restore the health status to pre-disaster levels, and establish a recovery process that will promote health and a preparedness level to even beyond the pre- disaster condition.
Public health professionals must take responsibility for community health in both disaster preparedness and response. The following are some of the roles of public health:
164

 Identification of community resources applicable to the physical, social, and psychological effects of disaster;
 Identification of groups most at risk of disaster (children, older adults; homeless, chronically ill, homebound, physically or mentally disabled);
 Provision of disaster education both in advance of (i.e., what to expect in disaster) and after (i.e. how to deal with effects) event;
 Taking responsibility for the health of community following a disaster;
 Using such resources as assessment, epidemiology, and data analysis to make and implement recommendations for limiting morbidity and mortality following disaster;
 Cooperation and collaboration with colleagues in the health sector to ensure that primary health, public health, mental health, and social impacts are adequately addressed in disaster planning;
 Prevention of diseases by providing health advisories on injury prevention, food and water safety, and vector control;
 Assuring that health services continue post impact including acute, continuity of care, primary care and emergency care;
 Inspection of shelters and feeding operations;
 Requesting volunteers from appropriate agencies like Red
Cross to supplement medical and nursing needs;
 Developing and advocating public policies designed to
reduce the public health impact of potential disasters;
165

 Communicating with government officials about the public health effects of potential disasters and providing expert assistances during and after disasters;
 Collaborating with other health and human service professionals to rigorously evaluate the intervention outcome.
The responsibilities of public health agencies in disaster preparedness and response are more complicated than in a typical public health activity. In order to discharge the above duties and responsibilities the public health team should develop an action plan.
6.2 Action plan
The health sector is responsible for ensuring the continuity of health care services. Components of the plan may include:
o Ensuring continuity of health care services (by checking the availability and functionality of all necessary resources);
o Monitoring environmental infrastructure (water, sanitation, and vector control);
o Assessing the needs of the elderly and other especial populations;
o Initiating injury prevention programs and surveillance;
o Ensuring that essential public health sector facilities will be
able to function post-impact
o Allocating resources to ensure that the above
responsibilities can be accomplished. 166

6.3 Functional model of public health response
The functional model summarizes a typical disaster response within the public health field and categories the cycle of activities. The model identifies tasks assigned to each of the core areas of public health in the context of emergency management activities.
The functional model outlined below comprises of six phases that correspond to the type of activities involved in preparing for and responding to a disaster: planning, prevention, assessment, response, surveillance, and recovery. The model additionally delineates the responsibilities of various disciplines of public health.
6.3.1 Planning:
 Apply basic concepts of local public health (promotion, prevention, control, curative and rehabilitation activities)to disaster management;
 Conduct health facilities disaster planning and coordinate with hospitals
 Help community develop plan with public health focus;
 Develop health promotion and disease prevention protocols
and motivate use through education campaign;
 Conduct needs assessments and analyze hazards and
vulnerability;
 Work with other health professionals to write a disaster plan
specifically for public health and health concerns;
 Train workforce on public health responsibilities;
167

 Inventory supplies, equipment, communications, and people available for response;
 Develop manual aid agreements in advance;
 Conduct facility-wide/agency-wide organizational mobilization, communication.
6.3.2 Prevention:
Primary prevention (before event):
exercises to stress coordination and
 Immunization;
 Control/prevent outbreaks;

National Policy on Disaster Management(NPDM)
1. Preamble
The Context
1.1.1 Disasters disrupt progress and destroy the hard-earned fruits of
painstaking developmental efforts, often pushing nations, in quest for
progress, back by several decades. Thus, efficient management of disasters,
rather than mere response to their occurrence has, in recent times, received
increased attention both within India and abroad. This is as much a result of
the recognition of the increasing frequency and intensity of disasters as it is
an acknowledgement that good governance, in a caring and civilised society,
needs to deal effectively with the devastating impact of disasters.
Disaster Risks in India
1.2.1 India is vulnerable, in varying degrees, to a large number of natural as
well as man-made disasters. 58.6 per cent of the landmass is prone to
earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity; over 40 million hectares (12
per cent of land) is prone to floods and river erosion; of the 7,516 km long
coastline, close to 5,700 km is prone to cyclones and tsunamis; 68 per cent
of the cultivable area is vulnerable to drought and hilly areas are at risk from
landslides and avalanches. Vulnerability to disasters/ emergencies of
Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) origin also exists.
Heightened vulnerabilities to disaster risks can be related to expanding
population, urbanization and industrialization, development within high-risk
zones, environmental degradation and climate change (Maps 1-4).
1.2.2 In the context of human vulnerability to disasters, the economically
and socially weaker segments of the population are the ones that are most
seriously affected. Within the vulnerable groups, elderly persons, women,
children - especially women rendered destitute and children orphaned on
account of disasters and the differently abled persons are exposed to higher
risks.

Paradigm shift in Disaster Management (DM)
1.3.1 On 23 December, 2005, the Government of India (GoI) took a
defining step by enacting the Disaster Management Act, 2005, (hereinafter
referred to as the Act) which envisaged the creation of the National Disaster
Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, State
Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by the Chief Ministers,
and District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs) headed by the
Collector or District Magistrate or Deputy Commissioner as the case may
be, to spearhead and adopt a holistic and integrated approach to DM. There
will be a paradigm shift, from the erstwhile relief-centric response to a
proactive prevention, mitigation and preparedness-driven approach for
conserving developmental gains and also to minimise losses of life,
livelihoods and property.

2.Approach and Objectives
Vision
2.1.1 To build a safe and disaster resilient India by developing a holistic,
proactive, multi-disaster oriented and technology driven strategy through a
culture of prevention, mitigation, preparedness and response.
Disaster Management

2.2.1 A disaster1 refers to a catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave
occurrence from natural or man-made causes, which is beyond the coping
capacity of the affected community. DM involves a continuous and
integrated process of planning, organising, coordinating and implementing
measures which are necessary or expedient for:
 Prevention of danger or threat of any disaster.
 Mitigation or reduction of risk of any disaster or its severity or
consequences.
 Capacity building including research and knowledge management.
 Preparedness to deal with any disaster.
 Prompt response to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.
 Assessing the severity or magnitude of effects of any disaster.
 Evacuation, rescue and relief.
 Rehabilitation and reconstruction.
2.2.2 A typical DM continuum comprises six elements; the pre-disaster
phase includes prevention, mitigation and preparedness, while the postdisaster phase includes response, rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery.

plans and execution.
 Capacity development in all spheres.
 Consolidation of past initiatives and best practices.
 Cooperation with agencies at national and international levels.
 Multi-sectoral synergy.
 Objectives
2.4.1 The objectives of the national policy on disaster management are:
Page 8 of 53
 Promoting a culture of prevention, preparedness and resilience at all
levels through knowledge, innovation and education.
 Encouraging mitigation measures based on technology, traditional
wisdom and environmental sustainability.
 Mainstreaming disaster management into the developmental planning
process.
 Establishing institutional and techno-legal frameworks to create an
enabling regulatory environment and a compliance regime.
 Ensuring efficient mechanism for identification, assessment and
monitoring of disaster risks.
 Developing contemporary forecasting and early warning systems
backed by responsive and failsafe communication with information
technology support.
 Promoting a productive partnership with the media to create
awareness and contributing towards capacity development.
 Ensuring efficient response and relief with a caring approach towards
the needs of the vulnerable sections of the society.
 Undertaking reconstruction as an opportunity to build disaster resilient
structures and habitat for ensuring safer living.
 Promoting productive and proactive partnership with media in disaster
management.

3. Institutional and Legal Arrangements
Disaster Management Act, 2005
[[
3.1.1 The Act lays down institutional, legal, financial and coordination
mechanisms at the national, state, district and local levels. These institutions
are not parallel structures and will work in close harmony. The new
institutional framework is expected to usher in a paradigm shift in DM
from relief-centric approach to a proactive regime that lays greater emphasis
on preparedness, prevention and mitigation.
Institutional Framework under the DM Act
National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)
3.2.1 The NDMA, as the apex body for disaster management, is headed by
the Prime Minister and has the responsibility for laying down policies, plans
and guidelines for DM (and coordinating their enforcement and
implementation for ensuring timely and effective response to disasters) . The
guidelines will assist the Central Ministries, Departments and States to
formulate their respective DM plans. It will approve the National Disaster
Management and DM plans of the Central Ministries/Departments. It will
take such other measures as it may consider necessary, for the prevention of
disasters, or mitigation, or preparedness and capacity building, for dealing
with a threatening disaster situation or disaster. Central ministries/
departments and State Governments will extend necessary cooperation and
assistance to NDMA for carrying out its mandate. It will oversee the
provision and application of funds for mitigation and preparedness
measures. NDMA has the power to authorize the Departments or authorities
concerned, to make emergency procurement of provisions or materials for
rescue and relief in a threatening disaster situation or disaster. The general
superintendence, direction and control of National Disaster Response Force
(NDRF) are vested in and will be exercised by the NDMA. The National
Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) works within the framework of
broad policies and guidelines laid down by NDMA.
Page 10 of 53
3.2.2. The NDMA is mandated to deal with all types of disasters, natural or
man-made. Whereas, such other emergencies including those requiring close
involvement of the security forces and/or intelligence agencies such as
terrorism (counter-insurgency), law and order situation, serial bomb blasts,
hijacking, air accidents, Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear
(CBRN) weapon systems, mine disasters, ports and harbour emergencies,
forest fires, oil field fires, and oil spills will continue to be handled by the
extant mechanism i.e., National Crisis Management Committee.
3.2.3 NDMA may, however, formulate guidelines and facilitate training and
preparedness activities in respect of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and
Nuclear (CBRN) emergencies. Cross cutting themes like medical
preparedness, psycho-social care and trauma, community based disaster
preparedness, information & communication technology, training,
preparedness, awareness generation etc. for natural and manmade disasters
will also engage the attention of NDMA in partnership with the stakeholders
concerned. Resources available with the disaster management authorities at
all level, which are capable of discharging emergency support functions, will
be made available to the nodal Ministries/Agencies dealing with the
emergencies at times of impending disasters/disasters.
The National Executive Committee

3.2.4 The National Executive Committee (NEC) comprises the Union
Home Secretary as the Chairperson, and the Secretaries to the GOI in the
Ministries/Departments of Agriculture, Atomic Energy, Defence, Drinking
Water Supply, Environment and Forests, Finance (Expenditure), Health,
Power, Rural Development, Science and Technology, Space,
Telecommunications, Urban Development, Water Resources and the Chief
of the Integrated Defence Staff of the Chiefs of Staff Committee as
members. Secretaries in the Ministry of External Affairs, Earth Sciences,
Human Resource Development, Mines, Shipping, Road Transport &
Highways and Secretary, NDMA will be special invitees to the meetings of
the NEC.
Page 11 of 53
3.2.5 The NEC is the executive committee of the NDMA, and is mandated
to assist the NDMA in the discharge of its functions and also ensure
compliance of the directions issued by the Central Government. NEC is to
coordinate the response in the event of any threatening disaster situation or
disaster. NEC will prepare the National Plan for Disaster Management based
on the National Policy on Disaster Management. NEC will monitor the
implementation of guidelines issued by NDMA. It will also perform such
other functions as may be prescribed by the Central Government in
consultation with the NDMA.
State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA)
3.2.6 At the State level, the SDMA, headed by the Chief Minister, will lay
down policies and plans for DM in the State. It will, inter alia approve the
State Plan in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the NDMA,
coordinate the implementation of the State Plan, recommend provision of
funds for mitigation and preparedness measures and review the
developmental plans of the different departments of the State to ensure
integration of prevention, preparedness and mitigation measures.
3.2.7 The State Government shall constitute a State Executive Committee
(SEC) to assist the SDMA in the performance of its functions. The SEC will
be headed by the Chief Secretary to the State Government and coordinate
and monitor the implementation of the National Policy, the National Plan
and the State Plan. The SEC will also provide information to the NDMA
relating to different aspects of DM.
District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA)
3.2.8 The DDMA will be headed by the District Collector, Deputy
Commissioner or District Magistrate as the case may be, with the elected
representative of the local authority as the Co-Chairperson. DDMA will act
as the planning, coordinating and implementing body for DM at District
Page 12 of 53
level and take all necessary measures for the purposes of DM in accordance
with the guidelines laid down by the NDMA and SDMA. It will, inter alia
prepare the District DM plan for the district and monitor the implementation
of the National Policy, the State Policy, the National Plan, the State Plan and
the District Plan. DDMA will also ensure that the guidelines for prevention,
mitigation, preparedness and response measures laid down by the NDMA
and the SDMA are followed by all Departments of the State Government at
the District level and the local authorities in the district.
Local Authorities
3.2.9 For the purpose of this policy, local authorities would include
Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI), Municipalities, District and Cantonment
Boards and Town Planning Authorities which control and manage civic
services. These bodies will ensure capacity building of their officers and
employees for managing disasters, carry out relief, rehabilitation and
reconstruction activities in the affected areas and will prepare DM Plans in
consonance with guidelines of the NDMA, SDMAs and DDMAs. Specific
institutional framework for dealing with disaster management issues in mega
cities will be put in place.
National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM)
3.2.10 The NIDM, in partnership with other research institutions has
capacity development as one of its major responsibilities, along with
training, research, documentation and development of a national level
information base. It will network with other knowledge-based institutions.
and function within the broad policies and guidelines laid down by the
NDMA. It will organize training of trainers, DM officials and other
stakeholders. The NIDM will strive to emerge as a ‘Centre of Excellence’ in
the field of Disaster Management.
Page 13 of 53
National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)
3.2.11 For the purpose of specialised response to a threatening disaster
situation or disasters/emergencies both natural and man-made such as those
of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear origin, the Act has
mandated the constitution of a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).
The general superintendence, direction and control of this force shall be
vested in and exercised by the NDMA and the command and supervision of
the Force shall vest in an officer to be appointed by the Central Government
as the Director General of Civil Defence and National Disaster Response
Force. Presently, the NDRF comprises eight battalions and further expansion
may be considered in due course. These battalions will be positioned at
different locations as may be required. NDRF units will maintain close
liaison with the designated State Governments and will be available to them
in the event of any serious threatening disaster situation. While the handling
of natural disasters rests with all the NDRF battalions, four battalions will
also be equipped and trained to respond to situations arising out of
Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear emergencies. Training
centres will be set up by respective para-military forces to train personnel
from NDRF battalions of respective Forces and will also meet the training
requirement of State/UT Disaster Response Forces. The NDRF units will
also impart basic training to all the stakeholders identified by the State
Governments in their respective locations. Further, a National Academy will
be set up to provide training for trainers in disaster management and to meet
related national and international commitments.
Experience in major disasters in the last decade has clearly established
the need for pre-positioning of some essential reserves at crucial locations,
including some for the high altitude areas. These reserves are intended to
augment the resources at the State level. Mitigation reserves will be placed
at the disposal of National Disaster Response Force for enhancing their
emergency responding capabilities for assisting the State Governments
during a disaster or disaster like situation.

Page 14 of 53
Existing Institutional Arrangements
Cabinet Committee on Management of Natural Calamities
(CCMNC) and the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS)
3.3.1 CCMNC had been constituted to oversee all aspects relating to the
management of natural calamities including assessment of the situation and
identification of measures and programmes considered necessary to reduce
its impact, monitor and suggest long term measures for prevention of such
calamities, formulate and recommend programmes for public awareness for
building up society’s resilience to them. The Cabinet Committee on
Security (CCS) deals with issues related to defence of the country, law &
order and internal security, policy matters concerning foreign affairs that
have internal or external security implications and economic and political
issues impinging on national security.
High Level Committee (HLC)
3.3.2 In the case of calamities of severe nature, Inter-Ministerial Central
Teams are deputed to the affected states for assessment of damage caused by
the calamity and the amount of relief assistance required. The IMG, headed
by the Union Home Secretary, scrutinises the assessment made by the
Central Teams and recommends the quantum of assistance to be provided to
the States from the National Calamity Contingency Fund (NCCF). However,
assessment of damages by IMG in respect of drought, hail-storm, and pest
attack will continue to be headed by the Secretary, M/o Agriculture &
Cooperation. The HLC comprising Finance Minister, as Chairman and the
Home Minister, Agriculture Minister & Deputy Chairman, Planning
Commission as members approves the central assistance to be provided to
the affected States based on the recommendations of the IMG. The
constitution and composition of HLC may vary from time to time. The Vice
Chairman, NDMA will be a special invitee to the HLC.
Page 15 of 53
Central Government
3.3.3 In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Central Government
will take all such measures, as it deems necessary or expedient, for the
purpose of DM and will coordinate actions of all agencies. The Central
Ministries and Departments will take into consideration the
recommendations of the State Government departments while deciding upon
the various pre- disaster requirements and for deciding upon the measures
for prevention and mitigation of disaster. It will ensure that Central
Ministries and Departments integrate measures for the prevention and
mitigation of disasters into their developmental plans and projects, make
appropriate allocation of funds for pre-disaster requirements and take
necessary measures for preparedness and to effectively respond to any
disaster situation or disaster. It will have the power to issue directions to
NEC, State Governments/SDMAs, SECs or any of their officers or
employees, to facilitate or assist in DM, and these bodies and officials shall
be bound to comply with such directions. The Central Government will
extend cooperation and assistance to State Governments as required by them
or otherwise deemed appropriate by it. It will take measures for the
deployment of the Armed Forces for disaster management. The Central
Government will also facilitate coordination with the UN Agencies,
international organisations and Governments of foreign countries in the field
of disaster management. Ministry of External Affairs in coordination with
MHA will facilitate external coordination/ cooperation.
Role of Central Ministries and Departments
3.3.4 As disaster management is a multi-disciplinary process, all Central
Ministries and Departments will have a key role in the field of disaster
management. The nodal Ministries and Departments of Government of India
(i.e. the Ministries of Agriculture, Atomic Energy, Civil Aviation, Earth
Sciences, Environment and Forests, Home Affairs, Health, Mines, Railways,
Space, Water Resources etc.) will continue to address specific disasters as
assigned to them.
Page 16 of 53
National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC)
3.3.5 The NCMC, comprising high level officials of the GoI headed by the
Cabinet Secretary, will continue to deal with major crises which have
serious or national ramifications. It will be supported by the Crisis
Management Groups (CMG) of the Central nodal Ministries and assisted by
NEC as may be necessary. The Secretary, NDMA may be a member of this
Committee.
State Governments

3.3.6 The primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the
States. The institutional mechanism put in place at the Centre, State and
District levels will help the States manage disasters in an effective manner.
3.3.7 The Act mandates the State Governments inter alia to take measures
for preparation of Disaster Management Plans, integration of measures for
prevention of disasters or mitigation into development plans, allocation of
funds, establishment of early warning systems, assist the Central
Government and other agencies in various aspects of Disaster Management.
District Administration
3.3.8 At the district level, District Disaster Management Authorities
(DDMAs), will act as the district planning, coordinating and implementing
body for disaster management and will take all measures for the purposes of
disaster management in the district in accordance with the guidelines laid by
NDMA and SDMA.
Management of Disasters impacting more than one State
3.3.9 At times, the impact of disasters occurring in one State may spread
over to the areas of other States. Similarly, preventive measures in respect of
Page 17 of 53
certain disasters, such as floods, etc may be required to be taken in one State,
as the impact of their occurrence may affect another. The administrative
hierarchy of the country is organized into the national, state and district level
administrations. This presents some difficulties in respect of disasters
impacting more than one State. Management of such situations calls for a
coordinated approach, which can respond to a range of issues quite different
from those that normally present themselves – before, during and after the
event. NDMA will encourage identification of such situations and promote
the establishment of mechanisms on the lines of Mutual Aid Agreement for
coordinated strategies for dealing with them by the states and central
ministries, departments and other agencies concerned.
Other Important Institutional Arrangements
Armed Forces
3.4.1 Conceptually, the Armed Forces are called upon to assist the civil
administration only when the situation is beyond their coping capability. In
practice, however, the armed forces form an important part of the
Government’s response capacity and are immediate responders in all serious
disaster situations. On account of their vast potential to meet any adverse
challenge, speed of operational response and the resources and capabilities at
their disposal, the armed forces have historically played a major role in
emergency support functions. These include communication, search and
rescue operations, health and medical facilities, and transportation,
especially in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The air and heli-lift and
movement of assistance to neighbouring countries primarily fall within the
expertise and domain of the armed forces. The armed forces will participate
in imparting training to trainers and DM managers, especially in CBRN
aspects, heli-insertion, high altitude rescue, watermanship and training of
paramedics. At the national level, the Chief of the Integrated Defence Staff
and the Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee has already been included in
the NEC. Similarly, at the State and District levels, the local representatives
of the armed forces may be included in their executive committees to ensure
closer coordination and cohesion.
Page 18 of 53
Central Para Military Forces
3.4.2 The Central Paramilitary forces, which are also the armed forces of
the Union, play a key role at the time of immediate response to disasters.
Besides contributing to the NDRF, they will develop adequate disaster
management capability within their own forces and respond to disasters
which may occur in the areas where they are posted. The local
representatives of the CPMFs may be co-opted/invited in the executive
committee at the State level.
State Police Forces and Fire Services
3.4.3 The State Police forces and the Fire Services are crucial immediate
responders to disasters. The police force will be trained and the Fire
Services upgraded to acquire multi-hazard rescue capability.
Civil Defence and Home Guards
3.4.4 The mandate of the Civil Defence and the Home Guards will be
redefined to assign an effective role in the field of disaster management.
They will be deployed for community preparedness and public awareness.
A culture of voluntary reporting to duty stations in the event of any disasters
will be promoted.
State Disaster Response Force (SDRF)
3.4.5 States will be encouraged to create response capabilities from within
their existing resources. To start with, each state may aim at equipping and
training one battalion equivalent force. They will also include women
members for looking after the needs of women and children. NDRF
battalions and their training institutions will assist the States/UTs in this
effort. The States/UTs will also be encouraged to include DM training in
Page 19 of 53
their respective Police Training Colleges and basic and in-service courses,
for gazetted and non-gazetted officers.
Role of National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service
Scheme (NSS) and Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan
(NYKS)
3.4.6 Potential of these youth based organisations will be optimised to
support all community based initiatives and DM training would be included
in their programmes.
International Cooperation
3.5.1 Disasters do not recognise geographical boundaries. Major disasters
may often simultaneously affect several countries. It will be the national
endeavour to develop close cooperation and coordination at the international
level in all spheres of DM.
Page 20 of 53
4. Financial Arrangements
Approach
4.1.1 In order to bring about a paradigm shift from the relief-centric
approach to the one covering prevention, preparedness and mitigation,
efforts would be made to mainstream prevention and mitigation measures
into the developmental plans and programmes by enlisting cooperation from
all stakeholders.
DM to be inbuilt in Developmental Plans
4.2.1 NDMA will ensure mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in
developmental agenda in all existing and new developmental programmes
and projects shall incorporate disaster resilient specifications in the design
and construction. The Planning Commission will give due weightage to
these factors while allocating resources.
National Disaster Response and Mitigation Funds
4.3.1. A National Disaster Response Fund may be constituted as mandated
in the Act. The National Disaster Response Fund will be applied by the
National Executive Committee (NEC) towards meeting the expenses for
emergency response, relief and rehabilitation, in accordance with the
guidelines laid down by the Central Government in consultation with the
NDMA. The proposal of merger of National Calamity Contingency Fund
(NCCF) with National Disaster Response Fund shall be as recommended by
the Finance Commission from time to time.
4.3.2. Similarly, as mandated by the Act, the National Disaster Mitigation
Fund (NDMF) may be created for projects exclusively for the purpose of
mitigation. NDMF shall be applied by the NDMA and shall be as
recommended by the Finance Commission from time to time.
Page 21 of 53
Responsibilities of the Central Ministries and Departments
4.4.1 All Central Ministries and Departments will prepare their DM plans
including the financial projections to support these plans. The necessary
budgetary allocations will be made as part of the Five Year and Annual
Plans.
State and District Level Arrangements
4.4.2 It shall be the responsibility of the States to constitute the Disaster
Mitigation and Response Funds at the State as well as District levels. The
modalities for the application of these funds will be worked out in
accordance with the provisions of the Act.
Mitigation Projects
4.4.3 The guidelines on various disasters will form the basis for the
formulation of plans for mitigation projects at the national, state and district
level. Central Ministries and Departments as well as the State Governments
will identify the Mitigation Projects for implementation. The national level
mitigation projects will be duly prioritised and approved in consultation with
the NDMA.
Techno-Financial Regime
4.5.1 Considering that the assistance provided by the Government for
rescue, relief and rehabilitation and reconstruction needs, cannot compensate
for massive losses on account of disasters, new financial tools such as
catastrophic risk financing, risk insurance, catastrophe bonds, micro-finance
and insurance etc will be promoted with innovative fiscal incentives to cover
such losses of individuals, communities and the corporate sector. In this
regard, Environmental Relief Fund under Public Liability Insurance Act,
1991, enacted for providing relief to chemical accident victims is worth
mentioning. Some financial practices such as disaster risk insurance, microfinance and micro-insurance, warranty of newly constructed houses and
structures and linking safe construction with home loans will be considered
for adoption.
Page 22 of 53
5. Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and
Preparedness
Disaster Prevention and Mitigation
5.1.1 Unlike man-made disasters, natural hazards like floods, earthquakes,
and cyclones cannot be avoided. However, with mitigation measures along
with proper planning of developmental work in the risk prone area, these
hazards can be prevented from turning into disasters. A three-pronged
approach needs to be adopted to undertake mitigation measures:
 Building mitigation measures into all development projects.
 Initiating of national level mitigation projects by the NDMA, in high
priority areas, with the help of the Central Ministries and Departments
concerned and the States.
 Encouraging and assisting State level mitigation projects in
accordance with the guidelines.
 Indigenous knowledge on disaster and coping mechanisms adopted
 by various States will be given due weightage with special focus on
 protection of heritage structures.
Risk Assessment and Vulnerability Mapping
5.1.2 Hazard zonation, mapping and vulnerability analysis in a multi-hazard
framework will be carried out utilising Geographic Information System
(GIS) based databases such as the National Database for Emergency
Management (NDEM) and National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). As
a first step towards addressing disaster vulnerabilities, Central Ministries
and Departments, national agencies, knowledge-based institutions and DM
authorities at the State and District levels need to carry out risk and
vulnerability assessment of all disaster prone areas. Hazard zonation
Page 23 of 53
mapping and vulnerability analysis based on GIS and remote sensing data,
needs to mandatorily include a ground check component. Hazard and
Consequence Mapping on GIS platforms prepared for chemical accident
prone districts.
5.1.3 The increasing use of GIS, remote sensing and applications of Global
Positioning Systems (GPS) in DM, has made it imperative to set up a
mechanism for sharing thematic and spatial data through a designated
electronic clearing house. The NSDI has been set up by the Survey of India,
to collect, compile, analyse and prepare value-added maps for use by
various agencies in the field of DM; for management of natural resources,
industrial applications etc. The NSDI need to work towards interoperability
of data and information sharing protocols to facilitate effective policy
analysis. A two-way interoperable link will be established between NSDI
and the National Disaster Emergency Communication network proposed in
the Policy for easy and quick sharing. The programme designed to have
spatial and non-spatial databases in a secure environment under the NDEM
will derive the data sets through NSDI for addressing the information needs
for disaster management.
Increasing Trend of Disasters in Urban Areas
5.1.4 Disasters in urban areas are distinct in many ways and the intensity of
damage is usually very high, warranting effective DM plans. Of late, there
has been an alarming increase in this types of disasters. Search and rescue
efforts in the urban areas also require specialized training. Action plans for
checking unplanned urbanization and ensuring safer human habitat against
all forms of disasters will be recognized as priority areas. State
Governments/UTs concerned should accord priority for improving urban
drainage systems with special focus on non-obstruction of natural drainage
system. Urban mapping of infrastructure of spatial resolution will be taken
up for development of Decision Support System (DSS) for management of
urban risks.
Critical Infrastructure
5.1.5 It is of utmost importance that critical infrastructure like dams, roads,
bridges, flyovers, railway lines, power stations, water storage towers,
irrigation canals, delta water distributor network, river and coastal
Page 24 of 53
embankments, ports and other civic utilities are constantly monitored for
safety standards in consonance with worldwide safety benchmarks and
strengthened where deficient. The building standards for these
infrastructures need to be aligned to the safety norms and concerned
Departments/Authorities would ensure the requisite actions and measures to
ensure this.
Environmentally Sustainable Development
5.1.6 Environmental considerations and developmental efforts, need to go
hand in hand for ensuring sustainability. Restoration of ecological balance in
the Himalayan regions and raising coastal shelter belt plantations need to be
incorporated wherever necessary in DM plans. Eco Systems of forests,
islands, coastal areas, rivers, agricultural urban environment and industrial
environment are also to be considered for restoration of ecological balances
and sustainable development. Zonal regulation must ensure the preservation
of natural habitats.
Climate Change Adaptation
5.1.7 Climate change is impacting on our glacial reserves, water balance,
agriculture, forestry, coastal ecology, bio- diversity and human and animal
health. There are definite indications that climate change would increase the
frequency and intensity of natural disasters like cyclone, flood and drought
in the coming years. In order to meet these challenges in a sustained and
effective manner, synergies in our approach and strategies for climate
change adaptation and disaster risk reduction shall be encouraged and
promoted.
Preparedness
Role of Central Ministries and Departments and States
5.2.1 States/UTs have to accord highest priority to building up their own
DM capabilities. Plans at all levels will be made in consonance with the
Page 25 of 53
guidelines and provisions in the DM Act, 2005. While the national plan will
be prepared by the NEC, the disaster and domain-specific plans will be made
by the respective central ministries and departments. State and District plans
will be prepared for their specific disaster related vulnerabilities in
accordance with the guidelines issued by NDMA. New institutional
mechanism may have to be built specifically in those sectors of DM where
none of the existing agencies are working towards the building of required
capacities.
5.2.2 The plans prepared by Central Ministries and Departments, States and
Districts will incorporate the inputs of all stakeholders for integration into
the planning process. The participation of all stakeholders, communities and
institutions will inculcate a culture of preparedness. A bottom-up approach
needs to be adopted for better understanding and operationalisation of these
plans.
5.2.3 The subject of DM will be included as a ‘standing item’ in the agenda
of the Inter State Council and Zonal Council and as a ‘reporting item’ in the
National Development Council.
Forecasting and Early Warning Systems
5.2.4 It is most essential to establish, upgrade and modernise the forecasting
and early-warning systems for all types of disasters. The nodal agencies
responsible for monitoring and carrying out surveillance, for specific natural
disasters, will identify technological gaps and formulate projects for their
upgradation, in a time bound manner. All States should provide to India
Meteorological Department the required infrastructure for upgradation/
establishment of meteorological observation systems. Partnership with the
World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), Pacific Tsunami Warning
System and other regional and global institutions may also be considered.
ICT tools need to be used for data receptions, forecasting and timely
dissemination.
Page 26 of 53
Communications and Information Technology (IT) Support
5.2.5 The basic communications and IT support requirements for disaster
management correspond to the following three levels:
 Decision makers and disaster managers at all levels.
 Real time dissemination of advance warnings and information to the
concerned authorities at various levels and threatened community. For
dissemination of advance warning and information through
broadcasting mediums such as television and radio shall be used
significantly as it has higher geographical reach. For coastal and hilly
regions, network of meteorological department may be used.
 Last mile connectivity at the disaster site for control and conduct of
rescue and relief operations.
5.2.6 Communication and sharing of upto-date information using state-of
the art IT infrastructure remain at the heart of effective implementation of
the disaster management strategy. Reliable, up-to-date and faster sharing of
geo-spatial information acquired from the field or the affected areas is a prerequisite for effective implementation of disaster management strategies.
Efforts should be made for setting up IT infrastructures consisting of
required IT processes, architecture and skills for quick up-gradation and
updation of data sets from the Panchayati Raj Institutions or the Urban Local
Bodies. A National Emergency Communication Network, involving the
contemporary space and terrestrial-based technologies in a highly synergistic
configuration and with considerable redundancy, will be developed. This
Network will ensure real time dissemination of warnings and information up
to the affected community and local authorities.
Strengthening of the Emergency Operations Centres
5.2.7 The establishment of Emergency Operations Centres at the national,
state, metros and district level and equipping them with the contemporary
Page 27 of 53
technologies and communication facilities and their periodic upgradation,
will be accorded priority. For the last mile connectivity and control of the
operations at the disaster hit areas, availability of portable platforms will be
catered for. The integration of Ham radios and such other innovative
facilities, into the DM communication system, will be advantageous.
Medical Preparedness and Mass Casualty Management
5.2.8 Medical preparedness is a crucial component for any DM Plan. The
NDMA, in close coordination with the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, states and premier medical research institutes will formulate policy
guidelines to enhance our capacity in emergency medical response and mass
casualty management. DM plans for hospitals will include developing and
training of medical teams and paramedics, capacity building, trauma and
psycho-social care, mass casualty management and triage. The surge and
casualty handling capacity of all hospitals, at the time of disasters, will be
worked out and recorded through a consultative process, by all the
states/UTs in the pre-disaster phase. The State and District authorities will
be encouraged to formulate appropriate procedures for treatment of
casualties by the private hospitals during the disasters. These plans will also
address post-disaster disease surveillance systems, networking with
hospitals, referral institutions and accessing services and facilities such as
availability of ambulances and blood banks.
5.2.9 Creation of mobile surgical teams, mobile hospitals and heliambulances for evacuation of patients is a crucial component of DM efforts.
The Accident Relief Medical Vans (ARMVs) of the Ministry of Railways,
stabled at stations every 100 km, will be utilised for emergency medical
response by the State and District authorities in consultation with the
Railways. The creation of additional bio-safety laboratories of level IV will
be addressed by the nodal ministry. There is a need to focus on creating
adequate mortuary facilities. Proper and speedy disposal of the dead bodies
and animal carcasses deserves due weightage.
Page 28 of 53
Training, Simulation and Mock Drills
5.2.10 Efficacy of plans and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) is tested
and refined through training, seminars and mock drills. The NDMA will
assist the states/UTs in these areas and will also conduct mock drills in
different parts of the country. State and district authorities will be
encouraged to generate a culture of preparedness and quick response.
Gradually State Governments will be encouraged to plan a series of
exercises for various types of disasters in collaboration with NDMA to
enhance the response level of various stakeholders.
Partnerships for Mitigation and Preparedness
Community Based Disaster Preparedness
5.3.1 During any disaster, communities are always not only the first to be
affected but also the first responders. Community participation ensures local
ownership, addresses local needs, and promotes volunteerism and mutual
help to prevent and minimise damage. Therefore, the efforts of the
states/UTs, in this regard need to be encouraged.
5.3.2 The needs of the elderly, women, children and differently abled
persons require special attention. Women and youth will be encouraged to
participate in decision making committees and action groups for
management of disasters. As first responders to any disaster, communities
will be trained in the various aspects of response such as first-aid, search and
rescue, management of community shelters, psycho-social counselling,
distribution of relief and accessing support from government/agencies etc.
Community plans will be dovetailed into the panchayat, block and district
plans.
Page 29 of 53
Stakeholders’ Participation
5.3.3 The participation of civil society stakeholders will be coordinated by
the SDMAs and DDMAs. Civil Defence, NCC, NYKS, NSS and local
NGOs will be encouraged to empower the community and generate
awareness through their respective institutional mechanisms. Efforts to
promote voluntary involvement will be actively encouraged.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Public Private
Partnership (PPP)
5.3.4 Historically, corporate sectors have been supporting the disaster relief
and rehabilitation activities. However, the involvement of corporate entities
in disaster risk reduction activities is not significant. Corporate entities
should redefine their business community plan to factor in hazards, risks and
vulnerabilities. They should also create value in innovative social
investments in the community. Public Private Partnership between the
Government and private sector would also be encouraged to leverage the
strengths of the latter in disaster management. The NDMA and SDMAs
need to network with the corporate entities to strengthen and formalise their
role in the DM process for ensuring safety of the communities.
Media Partnership
5.3.5 The media plays a critical role in information and knowledge
dissemination in all phases of DM. The versatile potential of both electronic
and print media needs to be fully utilised. Effective partnership with the
media will be worked out in the field of community awareness, early
warning and dissemination and education regarding various disasters.
Page 30 of 53
6.Techno-Legal Regime
Techno-Legal Regime
6.1.1 The DM Act, 2005, lays down the institutional and coordination
mechanisms at the national, state, district and local level. The relevant acts,
rules and regulations warranting amendments need to be identified and
brought in conformity with the DM Act in a phased manner by the central
and state governments and other agencies concerned.
Revision of Municipal Regulations
6.2.1 In view of the construction boom and rapid urbanisation, municipal
regulations such as development control regulations, building bye-laws and
structural safety features need to be revisited. These regulations will be
reviewed periodically to identify safety gaps from seismic, flood, landslide
and other disasters and suitable modifications will be made to align them to
revised building codes of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Undesirable
practices compromising safety during disasters, that tend to crop up from
time to time, will need to be addressed in the regulations. The utilisation of
unsuitable areas for construction, without necessary safeguards further
enhances vulnerability and needs to be guarded against through appropriate
compliance mechanisms. Similarly, the introduction of suitable regulations
for rural areas will also be emphasised. Where required, local bodies will be
provided with suitable financial incentives for the preparation of appropriate
regulations. This process will involve an all inclusive exercise involving due
sensitisation of governmental organisations at all levels, local authorities and
the community at large to accrue maximum results thereof.
Land Use Planning
6.3.1 Central Ministries and Departments concerned in consultation with
scientific institutions will carry out analysis of environmental and hazard
data for formulation of alternative land use plans for different geographical
and administrative areas with a holistic approach. This is more relevant to
Page 31 of 53
mega cities, metros and high-density urban settlements for safer location of
habitat and other critical facilities. A review of master plans and their
compliance, on priority, will be essential and regarded as the paramount
responsibility of the states/UTs. At macro-level, there is a need for
preparation of land use planning based on the inventory database of various
uses. As far as urban settlements are concerned, the future land use is to be
assessed keeping in view the anticipated intensity of development.
Safe Construction Practices
6.4.1 Hazards like earthquakes and cyclones do not kill people but
inadequately designed and badly constructed buildings do. Ensuring safe
construction of new buildings and retrofitting of selected lifeline buildings,
as given in the Earthquake Guidelines, is a critical step to be taken towards
earthquake mitigation. The design and specification of houses being
constructed, under the Indira Awas Yojana (IAY) and other government
welfare and development schemes, will also be re-examined to ensure
hazard safety. Building codes will be updated every five years as a
mandatory requirement and also put in the public domain. Observance of
National Building Code should be made mandatory in all the State/
Municipal building bye-laws.
Training of engineers, architects, small builders, construction
managers and artisans has already been started and need to be intensified at
the state and district level. Safe schools and hospitals (with large capacity)
and national monuments besides other critical lifeline buildings will be
regarded as a national priority. Enabling provision shall be made in all the
Centrally Sponsored Schemes and design the school buildings/hostels with
earthquake resilient features and to equip them with appropriate fire safety
measures.
Compliance Regime
6.5.1 There is a need for putting in place a sound compliance regime, with
binding consequences, to ensure the effectiveness of techno-legal and
techno-financial provisions. It is important to ensure that monitoring,
verification and compliance arrangements are in place both at the national
Page 32 of 53
and state level. It will be the responsibility of all stakeholders concerned, to
implement these provisions. Adoption of best management practices like self
certification, social audit, and an external compliance regime including audit
by professional agencies, need to be encouraged through development and
design of tools such as IT-enabled monitoring software to suit the DM
systems in India, in consultation with various stakeholders and knowledge
institutions for adoption after due trial and validation.
Enforcement
6.6.1 After having put the techno-legal and compliance system in place, the
states/UTs will also ensure their enforcement by establishing an effective
mechanism, under the provisions of the Act .
Page 33 of 53
7. Response
7.1.1 Prompt and effective response minimises loss of life and property. A
caring approach for the special needs of vulnerable sections is also
important. The existing and the new institutional arrangements need to
ensure an integrated, synergised and proactive approach in dealing with any
disaster. This is possible through contemporary forecasting and early
warning systems, fail-safe communication and anticipatory deployment of
the specialised response forces. A well informed and prepared community
can mitigate the impact of disasters.
Role of National Executive Committee (NEC)
7.2.1 NEC will coordinate response in the event of any threatening disaster
situation or disaster. While disaster specific guidelines will be formulated by
NDMA, NEC may give directions to the concerned Ministries/Departments
of the Govt. of India, the State Governments and the State Authorities
regarding measures to be taken by them in response to any specific
threatening disaster situation or disaster.
Role of the Nodal and Other Central Ministries and
Departments
7.3.1 For various types of disasters, the nodal Ministry concerned will chart
out detailed Response Plans which will be integrated into the National
Response Plan. The NEC may coordinate response in the event of any
threatening disaster situation or disaster.
Role of State, District and Local Authorities
7.4.1 It is the primary responsibility of the State Governments/SDMAs to
monitor and assess any developing situation and keep NDMA and NEC
apprised of the same. They will also be responsible to constantly evaluate
Page 34 of 53
their own capabilities to handle that situation and project the anticipated
requirements for the central resources well in time. Inter-State assistance and
cooperation will be encouraged. The States/UTs will also be responsible to
develop their own response potential progressively and complete the process
at the earliest. This will comprise training and equipping of state response
forces, community preparedness, training and creation of response caches at
the district level. District level preparations will provide the cutting edge to
all response activities. Local authorities, Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)
and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) will play a significant role in the entire
process, particularly in response and rescue operation, relief and
rehabilitation, awareness generation and disaster preparedness, restoration of
livelihood options and coordination with Non-Governmental Organisations
and civil society.
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
7.5.1 All Central Ministries, State Governments, District Authorities and
other stakeholders will prepare SOPs in consonance with the National and
State Plans. The SOPs will be prescribed for activities like search and
rescue, medical assistance and casualty management, evacuation, restoration
of essential services and communication at disaster sites, etc. The other
important activities are provision of food, drinking water, sanitation,
clothing and management of relief camps. Detailed SOPs will also be
devised by all concerned for despatch, receipt and deployment of central
resources.
Levels of Disasters
7.6.1 The Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for determining the levels
of disasters and for issuing alerts to electronic messaging systems to various
agencies about disasters have been formulated by Ministry of Home Affairs.
These SOPs will be reviewed periodically for disaster response management
in case of natural and manmade disasters.
Incident Command System (ICS)
7.7.1 A traditional command structure exists in the administrative hierarchy
which manages disasters in India. It has been planned to strengthen and
Page 35 of 53
professionalise the same by drawing upon the principles of the ICS with
suitable modifications. The ICS is essentially a management system to
organise various emergency functions in a standardised manner while
responding to any disaster. It will provide for specialist incident
management teams with an incident commander and officers trained in
different aspects of incident management, such as logistics, operations,
planning, safety, media management, etc. It also aims to put in place such
teams in each district by imparting training in different facets of incident
management to district level functionaries. The emphasis will be on the use
of technologies and contemporary systems of planning and execution with
connectivity to the joint operations room at all levels.
First and other Key Responders
7.8.1 The role and importance of community, under the leadership of the
local authorities, Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies
(ULBs), being the bedrock of the process of disaster response, is well
recognised. For their immediate support, there are other important first
responders like the police, State Disaster Response Force (SDRFs), Fire and
Medical Services. The NDRF will provide specialist response training
whenever required. In serious situations, the resources of all NDRF
battalions (18 teams per battalion), on an as required basis, will be
concentrated in the shortest possible time in the disaster affected areas.
Other important responders will be the Civil Defence, Home Guards and
youth organisations such as NCC, NSS and NYKS. The deployment of the
armed forces will also be organised on as required basis.
Establishment/raising of NDRF should progressively reduce deployment of
the Armed Forces. However, Armed Foreces would be deployed only when
the situation is beyond the coping capacity of State Government and NDRF.
Medical Response
7.9.1 Medical response has to be quick and effective. The execution of
medical response plans and deployment of medical resources warrant special
attention at the State and District level in most of the situations. The
Page 36 of 53
voluntary deployment of the nearest medical resources to the disaster site,
irrespective of the administrative boundaries, will be emphasised. Mobile
medical hospitals and other resources available with the centre will also be
provided to the states/UTs in a proactive manner. Post-disaster management
of health, sanitation and hygiene services is crucial to prevent an outbreak of
epidemics. Therefore a constant monitoring of any such possibilities will be
necessary.
Animal Care
7.10.1 Animals both domestic as well as wild are exposed to the effects of
natural and man-made disasters. It is necessary to devise appropriate
measures to protect animals and find means to shelter and feed them during
disasters and their aftermath, through a community effort, to the extent
possible. It is pertinent to note that many communities have shown
compassion to animals during disasters, and these efforts need to be
formalized in the preparedness plans. The Departments/Ministries of the GoI
such as Animal Husbandry and Dairy Department, Social Justice &
Empowerment and the States concerned should devise such measures at all
levels.
Information and Media Partnership
7.11.1 During disaster situations, the dissemination of accurate information
through electronic and print media is very important. Regular press briefings
by trained disaster management officials is essential. Training in information
management and accurate reporting will be undertaken at all levels.
Page 37 of 53
8. Relief and Rehabilitation
Approach
8.1.1 Relief is no longer perceived only as gratuitous assistance or provision
of emergency relief supplies on time. It is on the contrary, viewed as an
overarching system of facilitation of assistance to the victims of disaster for
their rehabilitation in States and ensuring social safety and security of the
affected persons. The relief needs to be prompt, adequate and of approved
standards. Guidelines defining minimum standards of relief will be prepared
by the NDMA.
Setting up of Temporary Relief Camps
8.2.1 DDMAs, especially in recurring disaster prone areas, may identify
locations for setting up temporary camps. Agencies to supply the necessary
stores will be identified in the pre-disaster phase. The use of premises of
educational institutions for setting up relief camps need to be discouraged.
8.2.2 The temporary relief camps will have adequate provision of drinking
water and bathing, sanitation and essential health-care facilities. Wherever
feasible, special task forces from amongst the disaster affected families will
be set up to explore the possibility of provision of food through community
kitchens, provision of education through the restoration of schools and
anganwadis. Efficient governance systems like entitlement cards, laminated
identification cards etc., will be developed as a part of a uniform
humanitarian governance practices through the respective DDMAs.
Management of Relief Supplies
8.3.1 Ensuring minimum standards of relief and speedy management of
supplies are important features of relief operations. SOPs will be put in place
for ensuring the procurement, packaging, transportation, storage and
Page 38 of 53
distribution of relief items, which need to be carried out in an organised
manner. The affected community and local authorities need to work in
tandem in managing the relief camps. Guidelines will be evolved to manage
the donations received in cash or kind to ensure transparency and
accountability.
Review of Standards of Relief
8.4.1 In most States, existing standards of relief need to be reviewed to
address the contemporary needs of communities affected by disasters. The
SDMAs may review the Relief Codes/manuals and prepare DM Codes for
prescribing the norms, standards and criteria for the provision of relief in
conformity with the guidelines of NDMA.
Temporary Livelihood Options and Socio-Economic
Rehabilitation
8.5.1 In the aftermath of any major disaster, generally a demand always
arises to generate temporary livelihood options for the affected community
and the State Governments should recognise this aspect in their DM
planning process. Any such option must ensure that assets, infrastructure and
the amenities created are hazard resistant, durable, sustainable, and costefficient.
Provision of Intermediate Shelters
8.6.1 In the case of devastating disasters, where extreme weather conditions
can be life-threatening or when the period of stay in temporary shelters is
likely to be long and uncertain, the construction of intermediate shelters with
suitable sanitary facilities will be undertaken to ensure a reasonable quality
of life to the affected people. The design of such shelters will be eco-friendly
and in consonance with local culture. It would be desirable for SDMAs to
plan during period of normalcy, the layout of intermediate shelters which is
cost effective and as per local needs with multi-use potential.
Page 39 of 53
9. Reconstruction and Recovery
Approach
9.1.1 The approach to the reconstruction process has to be comprehensive
so as to convert adversity into opportunity. Incorporating disaster resilient
features to ‘build back better’ will be the guiding principle. This phase
requires the most patient and painstaking effort by all concerned. The
administration, the stakeholders and the communities need to stay focused
on the needs of this phase as, with the passage of time, the sense of urgency
gets diluted. The appropriate choice of technology and project impact
assessment needs to be carried out to establish that the projects contemplated
do not create any side effects on the physical, socio-cultural or economic
environment of the communities in the affected areas or in their
neighbourhood. Systems for providing psycho-social support and trauma
counselling need to be developed for implementation during reconstruction
and recovery phase.
Owner Driven Reconstruction
9.2.1 Reconstruction plans and designing of houses need to be a
participatory process involving the government, affected community, NGOs
and the corporate sector. After the planning process is over, while owner
driven construction is a preferred option, contribution of the NGOs and
corporate sector will be encouraged. Reconstruction programme will be
within the confines and the qualitative specifications laid down by the
Government.
Speedy Reconstruction
9.3.1 Essential services, social infrastructure and intermediate
shelters/camps will be established in the shortest possible time. For
permanent reconstruction, ideally, the work including the construction of
houses must be completed within two to three years. Concerned Central
Page 40 of 53
Ministries/Departments and the State Governments should create dedicated
project teams to speed up the reconstruction process.
9.3.2 Contingency plans for reconstruction in highly disaster prone areas
need to be drawn out during the period of normalcy, which may include
architectural and structural designs in consultation with the various
stakeholders.
Linking Recovery with Safe Development
9.4.1 Emphasis will be laid on plugging the gaps in the social and economic
infrastructure and infirmities in the backward and forward linkages. Efforts
will be made to support and enhance the viability of the livelihood systems,
education, health-care facilities, care of the elderly, women and children, etc.
Other aspects warranting attention will be roads, housing, drinking water
sources, provision for sanitary facilities, availability of credit, supply of
agricultural inputs, upgradation of technologies in the on-farm and off-farm
activities, storage, processing, marketing, etc.
Livelihood Restoration
9.5.1 State governments will have to lay emphasis on the restoration of
permanent livelihood of those affected by disasters and special attention to
the needs of women-headed households, artisans, farmers and people
belonging to marginalised and vulnerable sections.

10. Capacity Development
Approach
10.1.1 A strategic approach to capacity development can be addressed
effectively only with the active and enthusiastic participation of the
stakeholders. This process comprises awareness generation, education,
training, Research and Development (R&D) etc. It further addresses putting
in place appropriate institutional framework, management systems and
allocation of resources for efficient prevention and handling of disasters.
10.1.2 As some of these aspects have been discussed in other chapters, this
part elaborates only awareness, disaster education and training. The
approach to capacity development will include:
 According priority to training for developing community based DM
systems for their specific needs in view of the regional diversities and
multi-hazard vulnerabilities.
 Conceptualisation of community based DM systems at the national
level through a consultative process involving the states and other
stakeholders with the state and local level authorities in charge of
implementation.
 Identification of knowledge-based institutions with proven
performance.
 Promotion of international and regional cooperation.
 Adoption of traditional and global best practices and technologies.
 Laying emphasis on table-top exercises, simulations, mock drills and
development of skills to test the plans.
 Capacity analysis of different disaster response groups at State/
District/ Local levels.
Page 42 of 53
National Priorities
10.2.1 In the field of capacity development, priority will be given to training
of DM officials, functionaries, trainers and elected representatives and
communities.
10.2.2 DM training and orientation of professionals like doctors, engineers,
and architects will be given due importance. Further, expansion of DM
training in educational institutions at all levels including schools, with
orientation towards practical requirements will be given due weightage.
Institutional Capacity Development
10.3.1 The NIDM will play an important role in developing and facilitating
the implementation of the national training schedule for DM. It will also be
the nodal institution for regional and international cooperation for training.
There are a number of renowned institutes in various states, which are
imparting training in DM. These will be strengthened with financial
assistance and such efforts will be replicated by States/UTs. Also, the DM
cells in all administrative training institutes, police academies, states
institutes of rural development, the four paramilitary training centres of the
NDRF and the National Training Academy will contribute most significantly
in developing DM related skills. The capacity of existing institutes needs to
be upgraded in accordance with regional and local requirements.
Training of Communities
10.4.1 Building the capacity of communities, as they are the first responders
to disasters, is a significant part of the capacity development process. It will
include awareness, sensitisation, orientation and developing skills of
communities and community leaders. Assistance from NDRF, Civil Defence
and NGOs/ other voluntary organisations such as the Red Cross and SelfHelp Groups will be encouraged. The overall responsibility to give impetus
to leadership and motivation will rest with local authorities, PRIs and ULBs
under the overall guidance of State and District authorities.
Page 43 of 53
Professional Technical Education
10.5.1 The curricula of graduate and postgraduate level courses in
architecture, engineering, earth sciences and medicine will be reviewed by
the competent authorities to include the contemporary knowledge related to
DM in their respective specialised fields. The role of NCC and Boys Scout
may also be included in schools and colleges for disaster management
related work. At the national level, the Ministry of Human Resource
Development will encourage the development of DM as a distinct academic
discipline, in the universities and institutes of technical excellence.
DM Education in Schools
10.6.1 The introduction of the subject of DM, by the Ministry of Human
Resource Development, in the curriculum through the Central Board of
Secondary Education, will be extended to all schools through their
Secondary Education Boards. State Government will also ensure the
inclusion of Disaster Management curriculum through State School Boards.
The education content will inculcate skill based training, psychological
resilience and qualities of leadership. The role of NCC and Boys Scout may
also be included in schools and colleges for disaster management related
work. Disaster education will aim at developing a culture of preparedness
and safety, besides implementing school DM plans.
Training of Artisans
10.7.1 The upgradation of the skills of artisans is another crucial component
of Capacity building process. The Central Ministries and Departments
concerned will ensure the availability of resources for sustainable
programmes to train artisans. The States will be encouraged to promote this
activity vigorously. The guidance of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs)
and National Institutes of Technology (NITs) will be sought to plan these
programmes. The implementation will be assisted by Industrial Training
Institutes (ITIs) and other Central, Regional and State Vocational Training
Page 44 of 53
Institutes. To ensure widespread participation, these programmes will be
made available. Private builders, contractors and NGOs are expected to play
a significant role in utilising trained artisans.
Training of other Groups
10.8.1 Other professional groups such as paramedics, social workers,
plumbers, sanitary fitters and safety auditors also play a very important role
in community based DM. These groups will also be provided training
through suitable programmes.
Licensing and Certification
10.9.1 Testing the skills of professionals becomes important to ensure
disaster resilient construction in the built environment. BIS will be
requested to develop uniform codes and specifications with the help of
professional bodies. The State Governments will develop a scheme to ensure
that only adequately qualified professionals practise within its territory. The
State Governments will also enforce their own registration benchmarks to
uphold desirable standards commensurate with their risk profile.
Page 45 of 53
11. Knowledge Management
Approach
11.1.1 Knowledge management will synthesise the techno-centric
organisational and ecological practices to strengthen the process of informed
decision making. There is a need to create a network of knowledge
institutions, in the field of DM, to share their experiences and knowledge.
While knowledge creation will be primarily carried out in specialised
domains by nodal institutions, the NIDM and other similar institutions will
play an important role in knowledge synthesis, data management and
dissemination amongst its clientele groups, especially other training
institutions.
Synergetic Application of Science and Technology
11.2.1 The Ministries of Science and Technology and Earth Sciences and
the other concerned Departments of the GoI, in consultation with NDMA,
will identify the specific needs and disciplines for research and also
designate domain-specific institutions depending on their expertise and
knowledge base.
Knowledge Institutions
11.3.1 The NIDM and other institutions will collaborate and bring together
academic and training institutions at the national, regional and international
levels. These institutions will form the knowledge repository in DM, and
also strive to enhance the knowledge base.
Page 46 of 53
Knowledge Dissemination through Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT)
Indigenous Technical Knowledge (ITK)
11.4.1 A rich legacy of technical knowledge and experience has been
handed down right from ancient times by way of tried and tested practices in
facing disasters in different parts of India. A concerted effort will be made to
catalogue this precious heritage, validate the products through contemporary
systems and disseminate the results to appropriate destinations and affected
communities with a view to adding value to their DM effort.
India Disaster Resource Network (IDRN)
11.5.1 The existing framework of IDRN needs to be further expanded to
include the resources of various agencies, domains and disciplines at the
national level. The relevant information will be placed in the public domain
for easy retrieval, usage and on-line updation.
India Disaster Knowledge Network (IDKN)
11.6.1 In acknowledgment of the need for a knowledge sharing platform on
DM, and to facilitate interaction and dialogue with related areas of expertise,
the India Disaster Knowledge Network Portal has been set up. The portal
will serve as a tool to collect, collate and disseminate information related to
DM. It will connect all Government Departments, statutory agencies,
research organisations/institutions and humanitarian organisations to share
collectively and individually their knowledge and technical expertise.
Documentation of Best Practices and Research
11.7.1 In the immediate aftermath of any disaster, field studies will be
carried out, with the help of experts, as an institutional measure. These
Page 47 of 53
studies will concentrate on identifying gaps in the existing prevention and
mitigation measures and also evaluate the status of preparedness and
response. Similarly, the lessons of past disasters will also be compiled and
documented. The recovery and reconstruction process will also be analysed
for further refining the DM processes and training needs. With the help of
experts, NIDM will develop a reference book for the development of case
studies and documentation of best practices in a professional manner. This
knowledge will be disseminated to all concerned within the country and also
shared with international organisations.
Page 48 of 53
12. Research and Development
Approach
12.1.1 Hitherto, a relief-centric approach has confined the research and
development effort to restricted domains. A primary concern of future effort
in these areas will be the identification of broad research needs in respect of
different hazards in various parts of India and intensifying demand driven
research programmes. Regional and international collaboration need to be
encouraged.
Institutional Arrangements
12.2.1 The entire DM architecture needs to be supported by a solid
foundation of frontline R&D efforts, offering sound and state-of-the-art
science and technology options in a user friendly manner. A proactive
strategy to enhance mutual reinforcement and synergy amongst the various
groups and institutions working in the field of DM will be recognised.
Pooling and sharing of perspectives, information and expertise will be
promoted by encouraging such efforts. The identification of transdisciplinary concerns through a process of ‘integration’ of the talent pool
groups will be facilitated and addressed by a standing mechanism at the
national and state level. Close interaction with Central Ministries and
Departments of Agriculture, Atomic Energy, Earth Science, Environment
and Forests, Health, Industry, Science and Technology , Space and with
academic institutions such as the IITs, NITs and universities, etc., will be
maintained.
Identification of Needs and Promotion of Research
12.3.1 A core group of experts from scientific and technical institutions has
already been set up by the NDMA to identify broad research needs in
disaster risk reduction. They will also identify research partners/ agencies/
Page 49 of 53
groups depending on their knowledge base and expertise. Emphasis will be
laid on climate change and global warming with specific relevance to India.
12.3.2 The research on cross cutting themes including on technological and
man-made disasters will be promoted in addition to natural disasters.
Research and Development in areas such as micro-zonation and scenario
development based on simulation studies will also be encouraged to assess
the short-term and long-term consequences of these disasters.
Page 50 of 53
13. Road Ahead
13.1.1 The enunciation of this policy represents merely the first step in the
new journey. It is an instrument that hopes to build the overarching edifice
within which specific actions need to be taken by various institutions and
individuals at all levels. A destination has been described and, hopefully, a
direction shown. The stage has been set, and the roadmaps now need to be
rolled out.
13.1.2 This document has endeavoured to capture, in its essence, the
vigorously enabling environment, which the body politic has put in place
through an Act of Parliament that heralds the onset of a different approach in
dealing with disasters that have, in the past taken a heavy toll of lives and
properties and crippled the economic base of communities. It also illustrates
realisation of the fact that disasters not only cause a setback to economic and
developmental growth, but also seriously affect the national security
environment.
13.1.3 The central theme is the belief that a disaster intelligent and resilient
community, duly empowered by a newly created DM Structure, working in
cohesion multi-sectorally, will help realise the national vision.
13.1.4 This is also an expression of the firm conviction of the national
leadership to make necessary financial allocations for Prevention,
Preparedness and Mitigation rather than fruitlessly incur post-disaster
expenditure year after year.
13.1.5 This policy will have served its purpose, if those that are charged
with the responsibility of carrying the task forward, find that their hands
have received from it, the strength and direction that they need.

The prevention of loss to life and property
due to natural calamities is being viewed very
seriously by the Government of India. In the past,
the main role played by the Government in the
case of various disasters was confined mainly
to post-disaster activities that included providing
relief and organising rehabilitation. The Uttarkashi
Earthquake of 1991, Killari Earthquake of 1993
and the devastating Malpa landslide along the
Kailash-Mansarovar route in 1998 acted as an
eye-opener for the Government. The need was
felt for a proactive approach rather than waiting
for a disaster to occur. As a part of this strategy,
the Government decided to institute task forces
for landslide hazard zonation, geotechnical
investigations, and land use zonation and
regulation. It was however the Kutch Earthquake
of 26 January 2001 that led to a paradigm shift in
the policies of the Government.
A review of the disaster management
mechanism was carried out by the Government in
June 2002 and the subject of disaster management
was shifted from the Ministry of Agriculture to the
Ministry of Home Affairs. The latter was declared
as the nodal ministry for coordination of relief
and response and overall disaster management.
Subsequently, the Geological Survey of India was
declared the nodal agency for landslides by the
Government in January 2004. The responsibilities of
the Ministry of Mines/Geological Survey of India as
the nodal ministry/agency include coordinating all
the activities related to landslide hazard mitigation,
and monitoring the occurrence of landslides in the
country. The Disaster Management Act, 2005, was
enacted on 23 December 2005 and the National
Disaster Management Authority, a statutory body
under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister as
provided for in this Act, was set up. As per the
Disaster Management Act, the responsibility to
cope with natural disasters is essentially that of
state governments and the role of the central
government is a supportive one in terms of
supplementing physical and financial resources.
At the state level, each state government is to set
up a state disaster management authority under
the chairpersonship of the chief minister. At the
district level, the collector/district magistrate/
deputy commissioner is the chairperson of the
district disaster management authority and directs,
coordinates and supervises disaster management
activities.
Landslide Risk
Landslides are one of the natural hazards
that affect at least 15 per cent of the land area of
our country—an area which exceeds 0.49 million
km2
. Landslides of different types are frequent in
geodynamically active domains in the Himalayan
and Arakan-Yoma belt of the North-Eastern parts
of the country as well as in the relatively stable
domains of the Meghalaya Plateau, Western Ghats
and Nilgiri Hills. In all, 22 states and parts of the
Union Territory of Pudducherry and Andaman &
Nicobar Islands are affected by this hazard. The
phenomenon of landslides is pronounced during
the monsoon period.
For a long time landslides have had disastrous
consequences causing enormous economic
losses and affecting the social fabric. In 2005
alone, more than 500 human lives were lost due
to this hazard in our country.
xxviii
Approach to the Guidelines
In order to reduce the enormous destructive
potential of landslides and to minimise the
consequential losses, it is necessary that the
hazard must first be recognised, the risk analysed
and an appropriate strategy developed at the
national level to mitigate its impact. To achieve
this objective, the National Disaster Management
Authority initiated a series of consultations for
drafting the National Guidelines on Landslides
and Snow Avalanches to guide the activities
envisaged for mitigating the risk emanating
from landslides at all levels. The main objectives
of these Guidelines are to institutionalise the
landslide hazard mitigation efforts, to make our
society aware of the various aspects of landslide
hazard in the country and to prepare the society
to take suitable action to reduce both risks and
costs associated with this hazard. The Guidelines
include regulatory and non-regulatory frameworks
with defined time schedules for all activities. It
is envisioned that all national and state disaster
management plans and policies for landslides will
be formulated and implemented keeping in view
the overall framework of the Guidelines.
Structure of the Guidelines
The following nine major areas have been
identified for systematic and coordinated
management of landslide hazards:
i) Landslide hazard, vulnerability, and risk
assessment.
ii) Multi-hazard conceptualisation.
iii) Landslide remediation practice.
iv) Research and development; monitoring
and early warning.
v) Knowledge network and management.
vi) Capacity building and training.
vii) Public awareness and education.
viii) Emergency preparedness and response.
ix) Regulation and enforcement.
Landslide Hazard Zonation
The above areas would need to be addressed
for minimising the impact of landslides. Landslide
hazard and risk assessment will be done through
landslide hazard zonation mapping and geological
and geotechnical investigation of vulnerable
slopes and existing landslides. Building inventory
databases has been considered an integral part of
this exercise. Hazard zonation mapping involves:
i) Creation of landslide inventory.
ii) Selecting scales for mapping depending
upon end-user requirements.
iii) Selecting landslide hazard zonation
methodologies for different scales.
iv) Multi-hazard integration especially integrating
seismic hazard.
v) Prioritisation of areas for landslide hazard
zonation mapping.
vi) Landslide risk zonation.
Investigations for Landslide Risk
Assessment
Geological and geotechnical investigations
of landslide risk assessment involve a
multidisciplinary approach where engineering
geologists and geotechnical engineers are an
integral part of the investigating team. The
investigations include preliminary stage geological
investigations, detailed geological investigations
and geotechnical investigations. As an aid to
the development of a systematic method and
development of standard codes, and planning and
capacity building for geological and geotechnical
investigations, a few major disastrous landslides
will be identified for creating pace setter examples
of detailed investigations. These pace setting
investigations will be carried out by assigning tasks
Executive Summary
xxix
to the identified organisations having necessary
expertise and experience. The state geology
and mining directorates will be made an integral
part of these pilot projects as a part of capacity
development.
Strategies for Landslide Risk Treatment
Landslide risk treatment is the ultimate
objective of the risk management process which
aims to mitigate the effects of the hazard. This
encompasses a five-pronged strategy comprising:
i) Treating vulnerable slopes and existing
hazardous landslides.
ii) Restricting development in landslide-prone
areas.
iii) Preparing codes for excavation, construction
and grading.
iv) Protecting existing developments.
v) Monitoring and warning systems.
vi) Putting in place arrangements for landslide
insurance and compensation for losses.
Risk treatment of already distressed slopes
includes the four broad types of landslide
remediation practices for slope stabilisation,
namely: control works, restraint works, slope
protection works and mass improvement
techniques. Mitigation measures for landslide
dams have been given special attention as a large
portion of the hazard prone area in the Himalayas
is susceptible to the formation of such dams
with disastrous possibilities. Protecting heritage
structures from landslide damage has also been
given due attention.
Monitoring and Forecasting of Landslides
The monitoring and forecasting of landslides,
which are two of the least developed fields of
landslide management practice will be given
special attention as a part of mitigating the risk
arising from landslide hazard. Monitoring of
landslides includes:
i) Surface measurements of landslide activity.
ii) Sub-surface measurements of landslide
activity.
iii) Total regime measurements.
These methods are very useful in
comprehending slope movement. However, only
real-time monitoring of landslides can pick up
minor changes from minute to minute and helps
in understanding the dynamic behaviour of a
landslide. Real-time monitoring can give a sound
technological basis for issuing warning signals.
Another important aspect is the development
of early warning systems for landslides. Early
warning is a process which involves three
components:
i) Scientific and technical communities.
ii) Government authorities and civil agencies.
iii) Local communities.
In addition to the first two, the third one, i.e.,
involvement of local communities in the process
of early warning is crucially important. An aware
and vigilant community sensitised to the warning
signs of impending landslides is the vital pillar
for implementation of an effective early warning
system. Early warning systems also comprise a
scientific and technological base, mechanisms
of dissemination and transmission of information,
and response capability on receipt of warning
information. It is imperative to execute a few
pilot projects as pace setters of early warning
systems which will also promote confidence in
their operational capabilities.
Snow Avalanches
The issues related to snow avalanches,
which affect certain areas in the Himalayas at
Executive Summary
xxx
regular intervals have also been taken up in these
Guidelines along with landslides. A brief summary
of the types of avalanches, their causes, their
forecasting possibilities and the control strategies
is presented. Since the recording of avalanche
data and their clearance is chiefly carried out by
the Border Roads Organisation, and forecasting
and control of snow avalanches are generally
dealt with by the Snow and Avalanche Studies
Establishment, the management of this hazard will
be a collaborative work of the National Disaster
Management Authority, district administration,
Border Roads Organisation, Snow and Avalanche
Studies Establishment, and academic institutions
active in carrying out research in this field.
Research and Development on Landslides
Landslide studies are a developing field of
science. Extensive and intensive research and
development activities are required to be taken up
by institutions and individual experts to attain the
goals set by the Guidelines. A few vitally important
topics of research identified are:
i) Standardisation of landslide hazard zonation
mapping and site specific studies.
ii) Understanding earthquake induced landslides
and the required remedial measures.
iii) Design of surface and sub-surface drainage
systems for stabilisation of slopes.
iv) Instrumentation for geotechnical
investigation to conduct a detailed study
of landslides.
v) Development of early warning systems.
vi) Facets of landslide dams.
vii) Run out and return period modelling of
landslides.
viii) Simulation and modelling of snow
avalanches.
ix) Landslides and snow avalanches in relation
to global warming and climate change.
Success of research and development efforts
will depend on institutionalisation of a system
with streamlined procedures for speedy funding
of priority/fast track projects. The mechanism for
evaluation of project proposals, periodic reviews and
final reviews should be an integral part of the system.
Awareness and Preparedness
The issues related to awareness and
preparedness are considered to be of crucial
importance in both the pre- and post-disaster
management processes. Mechanisms will be
initiated for creating awareness among various
stakeholders including government officials, local
communities and non-governmental organisations
on a sustained basis in landslide affected regions
so that all the stakeholders are empowered by
information and knowledge and mentally prepared
to face the hazard.
Capacity Building
Capacity building is an important component
of the disaster management process and is a
field which needs attention. The requirement and
importance of introducing appropriate capacity
development interventions including capacity
upgradation of institutions and organisations,
education and training of stakeholders and
responders, and proper documentation is included
in the Guidelines. The identified institutions/
organisations will be entrusted with the
development of high-quality education material,
textbooks, films, technical documentation, training
courses, etc.
Post-disaster emergency response has been
considered an integral component of mitigation
efforts. The requirement of strengthening
emergency response capability in landslide prone
areas has been given emphasis. A coordinated
response mechanism will involve emergency
search and rescue, and relief; maintaining an
Executive Summary
xxxi
operational incident command system; nurturing
a community level disaster response mechanism;
defining the involvement, role and responsibilities
of all the stakeholders including the corporate
sector; delineating the role of specialised
paramilitary rescue teams; structuring emergency
logistics; and institutionalising a loss assessment
mechanism.
Adherence to Legal-Regulatory Regime
Improving the compliance regime through
appropriate regulation and enforcement is vital.
State governments/state disaster management
authorities of landslide affected areas in
consultation with the Ministry of Mines/Geological
Survey of India and National Disaster Management
Authority will establish the necessary techno-legal
and techno-financial mechanisms to address the
problem of landslide hazard in their respective
states. The existing landslide related codes will be
updated by review and suitable modifications. The
process has to be initiated for preparation of codes
on landslide risk evaluation and detailed geological
investigations of landslides. The compliance
regime has to be monitored and enforced for
establishing model planning for towns and
villages, thus ensuring safety in hazardous areas.
Development of State and District
Disaster Management Plans
The Guidelines include the preparation of
disaster management plans of central ministries
and departments, state governments and the
nodal agency in tune with the stated aims and
objectives. Implementation of the Guidelines at
the national level will begin with the preparation
of a detailed action plan (involving programmes
and activities) by the Ministry of Mines.
The National Plan will lay special emphasis
on the most vulnerable groups/communities
to enable and empower them to respond and
recover from the impact of landslide disasters.
The National Executive Committee will coordinate
preparation of the national disaster management
plan incorporating the disaster management plans
prepared by the central ministries/departments
and state governments for landslide affected
states and districts, which will be approved by
the National Disaster Management Authority. The
plan will be in consonance with the schedule of
activities in the Guidelines designed for effective
landslide hazard mitigation in the country. The
Ministry of Mines will keep the National Authority
apprised of the progress on a regular basis.
Similarly, concerned state authorities/departments
will develop their state level disaster management
plans and dovetail them with the national plan and
keep the National Authority informed.
These activities will be initiated by the central
ministries, departments and state governments,
other stakeholders, and the nodal agency as
parallel processes. These will be reviewed and
updated by a group of experts/advisory committee
to be constituted by the Ministry of Mines/nodal
agency in consultation with the National Disaster
Management Authority. This high level scientific
and technical committee will not only serve as a
think tank but also provide continuity in thought
and ideas to the national landslide mitigation
initiative.
Organisations Associated with
Landslide Hazard Management
There is a need to set up a central organisation
that will deal exclusively with all the fields of
landslide management in a comprehensive
manner. The central government through the
Ministry of Mines will, therefore, set up a centre
for landslide research, studies and management
in one of the landslide prone states to ensure
a wider view of landslides as a component of
the environment and bring the existing pool of
expertise in earth sciences (coastal stability,
Executive Summary
xxxii
Executive Summary
seismology and meteorology included) to bear
upon this new initiative.
Financial Allocation for Landslide
Hazard Management
The scheme of financial allocations for
landslide hazard management has also been
delineated. In the Five-Year and Annual Plans,
the central and state ministries/departments will
make specific allocations for landslide disaster
management related activities. In addition 10
per cent of the Calamity Relief Fund will also be
made available for the purchase of equipment for
landslide preparedness and mitigation, and for
rescue and relief operations. Besides these, the
National Disaster Management Authority has also
proposed to take up a national landslide mitigation
project in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan which will
aim to comprehensively deal with basic issues
of landslide hazard management in the country.
Highlights of Important Recommendations
Although management of landslides
requires coordinated and multi-faceted activities
among many stakeholders in the total disaster
management cycle, a few of the important
recommendations made are listed below:
i) Developing and continuously updating the
inventory of landslide incidences affecting
the country.
ii) Landslide hazard zonation mapping in
macro and meso scales after identification
and prioritisation of the areas in consultation
with the Border Roads Organisation, state
governments and local communities.
iii) Taking up pilot projects in different regions
of the country with a view to carry out
detailed studies and monitoring of selected
landslides to assess their stability status
and estimate risk.
iv) Setting pace setter examples for
stabilisation of slides and also setting up
early warning systems depending on the
risk evaluation and cost-benefit ratio.
v) Complete site specific studies of major
landslides and plan treatment measures,
and encourage state governments to
continue these measures.
vi) Setting up of institutional mechanisms for
generating awareness and preparedness
about landslide hazard among various
stakeholders.
vii) Enhancing landslide education, training of
professionals and capacity development
of organisations working in the field of
landslide management.
viii) Capacity development and training to make
the response regime more effective.
ix) Development of new codes and guidelines
on landslide studies and revision of existing
ones.
x) Establishment of an autonomous national
centre for landslide research, studies and
management.
Efficacy in managing landslides and avalanches
in the country is expected to improve substantially
after all these action points have been addressed
on a priority basis with a sense of urgency and duly
backed by requisite operational, legal, institutional,
and financial support.
Schedule for Completion of Action Points
The time lines proposed for the implementation
of various activities in the Guidelines are considered
both important and desirable, especially in
the case of those non-structural measures for
which no clearances are required from central or
other agencies. Precise schedules for structural
measures will, however, be evolved in the landslide

management plans that will follow at the central
ministries/state level duly taking into account the
availability of financial, technical and managerial
resources. In case of compelling circumstances
warranting a change, consultation with the
National Disaster Management Authority will be
undertaken, well in advance, for any adjustment,
on a case to case basis.

Introduction
The Guidelines on Landslides and Snow
Avalanches chart out the regulatory and nonregulatory framework on the basis of which the
national and state disaster management plans and
policies are to be formulated and implemented.
The task of mitigating landslide hazards has to be a
coordinated effort of the central government, state
government, local authorities, non-governmental
organisations and other stakeholders including
communities living in landslide-prone hilly regions.
These plans will be reviewed and updated at
periodic intervals and implemented through
appropriate, well-coordinated and time-bound
actions as laid down in these Guidelines at the
national, state and local levels. As the growth of
urban, semi-urban and rural centres, infrastructural
developments, and other developmental activities
in landslide prone areas increases, the risk of
landslides will rise manifold unless mitigation issues
are addressed adequately. Therefore, all agencies
concerned are required to ensure implementation
of these Guidelines.
Guidelines for Landslide and Snow
Avalanches Disaster Management
The National Disaster Management Guidelines
for Management of Landslides and Snow
Avalanches include a wide range of scientific,
planning, and administrative tools to address
various aspects of these hazards to effectively
reduce losses from them. These include nine
major elements to enhance the effectiveness of
managing the above hazards in the country:
Landslide Hazard, Vulnerability and Risk
Assessment: This includes delineating areas
susceptible to landslide hazards and status of
landslide hazards in different areas and to assess
the resources at risk due to these hazards as
per the requirement of communities and for
planning and decision making purposes. This
also involves site specific studies of landslides
and preparation of landslide inventory. The study
of snow avalanches can also be included in this.
Multi-Hazard Conceptualisation: Integrating
landslide concerns into multi-hazard disaster
management plans at different levels for effective
risk assessment, mitigation and response.
Landslide Remediation Practice: Encouraging
implementation of successful landslide
remediation and mitigation technologies, and
execution of pace setter examples in mitigation
and remediation strategies to build confidence
amongst the affected communities. This also
includes monitoring of landslides and development
of early warning systems.
Research and Development; Monitoring and
Early Warning: The study of landslide hazards is
an area that requires active research. Unlike many
other violent acts of nature, landslide hazards
can be mapped out, predicted and contained,
provided that a synergy of detailed plans, an
aware community and scientific research are
established. Research is of critical importance
in managing landslides. Developing a predictive
understanding of landslide processes and
triggering mechanism; regional real-time landslide
warning systems based on threshold values of
rainfall; real-time monitoring and establishing
early warning systems in case of landslides that
pose substantial risk to developmental gains;
risk assessment and developing methodologies
Overview of the Guidelines
xxxv
for assessing the potential co-seismic slides are
some of the important fields of research that need
immediate attention.
Knowledge Network and Management:
Establishing an effective system for gathering
information on landslides, loss assessment
resulting from landslides, and the effective
dissemination of technical information and
maps is an essential component of the disaster
management process. A web portal—the India
Disaster Knowledge Network (IDKN) will be
launched at the National level.
Capacity Building and Training: Developing
institutional capacity and training for geoscientists,
engineers, and planners is necessary for effective
management of the landslide hazard. The
directorates of mining and geology of the state
governments require particular attention in this
regard as these can be focal points of most
scientific studies for landslides in the future. Risk
assessment methodology, detailed site specific
studies, etc., have to be standardised and existing
codes for landslide related practices have to be
suitably modified.
Public Awareness and Education: Effective
communication of landslide hazard issues to the
affected communities through education, public
awareness programmes, posters, audio-visual
aids, media campaigns, etc., is required.
The Components of the Landslide Disaster Management Process
Overview of the Guidelines
xxxvi
Emergency Preparedness and Response:
Development of coordinated landslide rapid
response capability involving scientists, engineers,
local authorities, the National Disaster Response
Force and paramilitary forces. Rescue, relief and
rehabilitation are covered in this component.
Regulation and Enforcement: Establishment of
a techno-legal mechanism of landslide hazard
assessment and mitigation with provisions for
enforcing compliance thereof are important.
Plan for Implementation of the
Guidelines
The central ministries and departments, and
state governments concerned in landslide affected
areas will designate nodal officers responsible for
landslide management activities and for effective
formulation and implementation of the disaster
management plans. The policies, initiatives
and activities of these agencies will address
the concerns of all stakeholders involved in the
development, management and maintenance of
the built-up environment to ensure safety.
The implementation of the disaster
management plans based on the Guidelines will
incorporate the following elements:
Central Policy Statements and Plans: This will
provide an overview of the resource management
issues; the mode of coordination between
central organisations and departments crucial
for landslide hazard management; and supervise
and monitor the implementation of the national
disaster management plan for landslides. The
National Executive Committee will prepare the
national disaster management plan, based on
the National Disaster Management Policy and
Guidelines, and will incorporate the key elements
of the plans prepared by various central ministries
and departments, and state governments. Fiveyear and annual plans of all central ministries/
departments and state governments will include
disaster management components to support the
activities spelt out in these plans. Remediation
and mitigation practices for lifeline structures,
national highways, the railway network and large
civil engineering structures like major power and
irrigation projects will be in direct purview of the
appropriate central ministries and departments
together with the involvement of local authorities.
The nodal agencies at the central and state
levels will encourage all stakeholders to set up
appropriate institutional mechanisms to ensure
that the national landslide safety agenda is not only
implemented but also closely monitored vis-à-vis
specific targets. Such nodal agencies will identify
appropriate agencies and institutions to develop
standardised training modules, to prepare public
awareness resource materials and to monitor the
implementation of the disaster management plans
based on these Guidelines.
State Policy and Plans: The state policy statement
of landslide prone states will identify landslides
as an issue, and then present objectives and
policies that explain how the issue will be
addressed. State plans will describe the significant
management issues facing the state and then set
out objectives, policies and methods (including
rules) to address these issues, and also outline
the results that are anticipated from their
implementation. The state must ensure that
their plans are consistent with national policy
statements and plans. Plan provisions need
to be appropriate to the geographical and
community circumstances. No single policy for
response to landslide disasters will fit the needs
of all sites because of wide variation in geology,
geomorphology, climatic conditions, and therefore
types and locations of landslides. The issues and
objectives among the districts threatened by
slope instability may be similar, but the methods
required to address the risk can be different. The
state governments will also constitute disaster
Overview of the Guidelines
xxxvii
management teams responsible for the total
disaster management cycle including mitigation,
early warning, rapid response, rehabilitation
and damage assessment. Response, relief and
rehabilitation will be a coordinated endeavour
of the disaster management teams, the central
ministries and departments concerned and the
local authorities.
District Plans: The district administration will
understand and gather information about landslide
hazards, estimate the appropriate level of risk and
identify the issues for mitigation thereof. District
plans for land use may be developed to minimise the
risk of landslide hazard. The district administration
will also create a community contingency fund for
tackling post-disaster issues. Since landslides are,
by and large, a localised phenomenon, district level
community based preparedness plans are crucial
for management of landslide disasters. The district
administration will be responsible for constituting
village level disaster management committees with
the responsibilities of initiating and implementing
disaster preparedness plans. They will include local
elected representatives, government functionaries,
local non-governmental organisations/community
based organisations and other local groups. These
committees will be responsible for identifying
locally available assets and resources that can be
utilised for building the capacities of the community
for organising search, rescue and relief during
and after disasters. Given an acceptable level of
awareness, local level early warning of landslides
is practicable to quite an extent.
Rules: These can be included in state plans
to control various aspects of development in
landslide hazard prone areas, including design,
construction, location and density. These will also
have provisions to ensure that the risk does not
increase by unplanned urbanisation, intensified
improper land-use or by new constructions in high
hazard areas.
Non-Regulatory Activities: These provisions will
dissuade people from putting themselves at risk
due to landslides. Information, education and
communication of information are the pillars of
this activity. Disaster management cells will be
set up with the responsibility of preparing and
disseminating the landslide susceptibility maps
for identifying, avoiding or mitigating the risk in
vulnerable areas.
Monitoring
The plans will specify monitoring mechanisms
with the following indicators:
i) Frequency of damaging landslides.
ii) Loss assessment.
iii) Mitigation methods used.
iv) Number of buildings being built on land at
risk.
v) Land subject to landslide activity being set
aside/purchased.
vi) The awareness level of the community.
Detailed documents need to be developed to
elaborate on the monitoring mechanisms to be
employed for undertaking a transparent, objective
and independent review of landslide mitigation
activities. Non-governmental organisations and
local bodies will be involved in the monitoring
process. If the monitoring process indicates that
the provisions are not reducing landslide risk, the
plans will be examined and may be revised and
modified, if required.
To measure the effectiveness of policies
and methods contained in plans, the results
of monitoring will be put in the public domain.
Keeping the communities informed is important
because it not only lets them know about
what is going on in terms of development and
implementation of disaster management plans,
Overview of the Guidelines
xxxviii
but also raises the level of awareness about
hazards in the community.
Goals and Milestones
The vision of the National Guidelines on
Landslides and Snow Avalanches is that of
a people sensitised to landslide hazards and
pursuing mitigating steps armed with scientific,
technological, planning, and policy capabilities to
eliminate all avoidable losses due to landslides.
The mission is to provide and encourage the use
of scientific information, maps, technology, and
guidance in mitigation techniques, emergency
management, land use planning, and development
and implementation of government policy to reduce
losses from landslides throughout the country.
Implementation of the National Disaster
Management Guidelines—Management of
Landslides and Snow Avalanches will result in a
number of major accomplishments, including the
following:
i) Reduced losses from landslides.
ii) Greater public awareness about landslide
hazards and methodologies for mitigating
losses.
iii) Improved technology for landslide
mitigation and remediation.
iv) Assessment and maps of landslide
susceptibility in landslide-prone areas.
v) Policies to encourage landslide hazard
mitigation through government agencies
with the involvement of communities.
vi) Creation of national databases/inventory
on landslide information.
vii) Preparation of training materials for
geologists, geo-technicians, engineers,
administrators, and planners.
viii) Curricula and training material for public
awareness on landslide hazards.
ix) Real-time monitoring of critically hazardous
landslides nationwide.
x) Establishment of a well-coordinated
landslide emergency response mechanism.
Operational issues
Successful implementation of the Guidelines
would require consideration of the following
operational issues:
Technical/Scientific
i) Integrating landslide concerns in the
development of disaster management
plans at different levels i.e., national, state,
district, municipal/panchayat.
ii) Networking of knowledge based institutions
dealing with landslide studies for effective
implementation of national landslide
agenda.
iii) Innovation in the management of multiinstitutional and multi-disciplinary teams.
iv) Switch-over from piecemeal remediation
of landslides to simultaneous and holistic
implementation of control measures.
v) Participation of the private sector and
insurance sector in disaster management
plans.
vi) Establishment of a disaster knowledge
network (a network of networks) and
a mechanism for dissemination of
information at the national level.
vii) Mechanism for international linkages,
cooperation and joint initiatives.
viii) Formation of expert committees for
distribution of workload, evaluation of
any project proposal, recommendation
for funding the project, scrutiny of the
project report, approval for implementation
of the suggested remediation measures
and assessment of the efficacy of
Overview of the Guidelines
xxxix
the recommendations after their
implementation.
Financial Issues
i) Criteria for disbursement of funds for
servicing different areas of landslide
mitigation.
ii) Building cost on preventive action and longterm maintenance of major problematic
slopes in the development budget.
iii) Creating a techno-financial regime for
landslide project implementation.
iv) Criteria for disbursement of landslide
mitigation funds to non-governmental
organisations.
Legal Issues
i) Techno-legal regime for introduction
of sound slope protection, planned
urbanisation, regulated land use and
environment friendly land management
practices.
ii) Zero tolerance against deliberate
environmental violence and unhealthy
construction practices.
iii) Laws governing new constructions
and alteration of existing land use on
problematic slopes and in landslide prone
areas.
Road Map and Milestone Activities
These Guidelines will come into force with
immediate effect. Keeping in view the goals,
the activities required for landslide disaster
management in the country have been divided
into three categories which are:
i) Vital,
ii) Essential, and
iii) Desirable.
These activities have been further divided into
short-term and long-term tasks depending upon
the quantum of work involved, resources available,
and impact of activity on disaster management.
Vital
The tasks categorised as vital are those which
are absolutely essential and would form the basis
for the operationalisation of other categories.
These will be taken up initially and some of them
may run concurrently with the activities of other
categories.
Short-Term Activities
The short-term activities include preparation
of status papers discussing the state-of-the-art
technologies available for different aspects of
landslides and landslide hazard management,
which will form the basis for future studies on
the subject. The topics covered may include
development of uniform methodologies for
landslide hazard zonation mapping on both
macro and meso scales; landslide monitoring;
detailed investigations of different types of
landslides; landslide remediation practices;
development of early warning systems including
correlation between rainfall and landslide activity;
and approach to awareness generation among
communities, administrators, decision makers,
and initial steps for capacity development at
various levels.
Developing and continuously updating
inventory of all landslide affected national
highways, state highways, strategic transportation
routes, human habitations and important civil
engineering projects, and the landslide incidents
impacting them.
Identification of the institutions engaged
in landslide studies and disaster management
at different levels, assess and upgrade their
Overview of the Guidelines
xl
technical and resource capabilities to involve them
effectively in the endeavour of landslide disaster
management.
Identification and prioritisation of areas to be
taken up for landslide hazard zonation mapping on
macro as well as meso scales in consultation with
Border Roads Organisation, state governments
and local communities.
Setting up an institutional mechanism for
generating awareness on landslide hazards
among various stakeholders, spreading landslide
education, and capacity development with a view
to achieving the above objectives. The exercises
for awareness generation will be planned and
initiated by identified agencies. The capacities
of different institutions and agencies will be
assessed and required measures to develop their
capacities will be initiated.
Taking up pilot projects in different regions
of the country with a view to carry out detailed
studies and monitoring of selected landslides,
assess their stability status and estimate risk.
The results of these studies will help in the
identification of a few landslides that can be taken
up for stabilisation or setting up an early warning
system in the long term.
Integrating the landslide and snow avalanche
hazard concerns into the multi-hazard concept as
this hazard does not find a place in the Vulnerability
Atlas of India published by the Building Materials
Technology Promotion Council which currently
includes earthquakes, cyclones and flood hazards.
This atlas should be a multi-hazard one and
include landslide and snow avalanche hazards as
well. Since this atlas is under revision, the matter
will be taken up with the Building Materials and
Technology Promotion Council to include these
hazards in its latest edition.
Long-Term Activities
The practice of controlling landslides is not a
systematic process in our country and therefore
has not met with much success. The results of
pilot studies proposed can be utilised to identify
the landslides that can be taken up for stabilisation
or setting up early warning systems depending on
the risk evaluation and cost-benefit ratio. These
studies would also serve as pace setter examples
to be followed in future and also in building up
confidence among various stakeholders about the
effectiveness of techniques and the importance
of studies.
Landslide hazard zonation mapping of the
identified priority areas is required to be carried
out before actual development is taken up.
The priority areas are to be identified based on
information from the concerned ministries and
state governments.
Essential
The activities next to vital in the order of
importance have been categorised as essential.
The activities for accomplishing the objectives
or tasks of this category have been grouped into
short-term and long-term activities.
Short-Term Activities
The short-term activities include preparation
of landslide hazard zonation maps of national
highways, state highways, and human habitations
which have been identified at risk, on macro
scales, in consultation with state governments;
preparation of landslide hazard zonation maps
for landslide prone habitations and sites of large
civil engineering projects on meso scales; taking
up a comprehensive programme to investigate
identified slides with a view to stabilise them;
identification of heritage structures that are

xli
vulnerable to landslide hazard and making plans to
preserve them; to conduct training programmes
for professionals on hazard, vulnerability,
risk assessment and damage assessment;
promote innovations in landslide education,
awareness generation among administrators
and communities; and establish modern search,
rescue and relief practices by introducing modern
search and rescue equipment and trained
personnel in landslide affected states. Creating
a network of institutions capable of carrying out
detailed studies and managing selected landslides
effectively by applying state-of-the-art technology.
Long-Term Activities
The long-term activities included in this
category are—systematic landslide hazard
zonation mapping of all the river basins in hilly
areas and publishing those maps in the form of an
atlas; the preparation of landslide hazard zonation
maps of all urban and rural habitations located in
hilly terrain as identified by state governments; to
complete site specific studies of major landslides
and plan treatment measures, and to encourage
state governments to continue these; to intensify
awareness generation programmes by involving
state government agencies, non-governmental
organisations and community organisations; to
set up monitoring systems for some high-risk
and difficult to manage landslides, to attempt
stabilising them after consultation with different
stakeholders and detailed risk analysis and
vulnerability assessment; and to plan early
warning systems at selected sites that are
difficult to stabilise. It is essential that the state
directorates of geology and mining be associated
with all the scientific and technical activities right
from the beginning.
Identification and selection of roads and
reservoir rim corridors for essential studies and
landslide analyses is to be undertaken in order
to prevent any possible loss to lifeline structures
such as dams and road links. It may even involve
monitoring in selected cases. A programme on
bio-remedial measures will be undertaken at the
grassroots level involving local communities.
Desirable
The activities that are in the desirable category
are also further sub-divided into short-term and
long-term sub-categories. The short-term activities
include establishment of a disaster knowledge
bank; development of new codes and guidelines,
and revision of the existing ones. The long-term
activities include development and establishment
of early warning systems for selected landslides
that pose high risk and are difficult to fully stabilise
with designed remedial measures. A mechanism
should be developed to prepare institutions to
take up these exercises regularly and improve
them based on feedback. Some of these activities
can be taken up concurrently with essential and
desired activities and some that are dependent
on the results of activities categorised as vital
and essential can be taken up during later phases.

The Context 1
1.1 Landslide Hazard—An Introduction
Humans have had to face the impact of natural
hazards from time immemorial. Natural hazards
such as earthquakes, landslides, avalanches,
floods, cyclones, droughts, and volcanic eruptions
of varying magnitudes have repeatedly been
the cause of calamities. According to statistics,
natural hazards are believed to account for up to
4 per cent of the total annual deaths world-wide,
besides causing enormous economic losses and
uprooting habitation. It has also been observed
that casualties resulting from natural hazards are
not evenly distributed throughout the world, but
are more concentrated in developing countries,
partly due to their higher population densities and
lack of preparedness.
Landslides form a significant component of
the natural disasters that affect most of the hilly
regions round the globe. Recent studies on global
landslide disasters indicate that some of the
highest risk landslide disaster zones are located in
Colombia, Tajikistan, India, China, and Nepal where
the estimated number of people killed per year
per 100 sq. km area was found to be more than
one. Historical records indicate that the highest
number of lives lost to a single landslide event
were in the earthquake-triggered landslide disaster
in Kansu Province of China in 1920. Another well
known landslide event of the last century was an
earthquake-triggered debris avalanche in 1970
on the slopes of Mt. Huascaran, Peru, which
advanced with an average speed of 320 km/hr,
burying the towns of Yungay and Ranrahirca, killing
more than 18,000 people. Similarly, in Europe, the
1963 Vaiont reservoir slide in North-Eastern Italy,
resulted in the death of 2,000 people.
Although the term landslide in the strict
sense may be defined as a process involving the
downward and outward movement of a part of the
slope forming material due to the action of gravity,
other forms of mass movements like falls, flows,
topples and creeps are generally included in the
term landslides. This document also considers
snow avalanches as within the ambit of landslide
management.
1.2 Landslide Vulnerability and Risk
in India
India’s vulnerability to landslides is seen
in the threat of landslides to our housing and
infrastructure, farms and fields, vast stretches
of border roads and railway lines, hydro-electric
and water supply installations, transmission
line projects, aerial ropeways, open cast mines,
tunnels, heritage buildings and monasteries,
pilgrim routes, and tourist spots. Having defined
the terms landslide hazard, vulnerability, and risk, it
follows that the scientific approach to dealing with
the perceived threat is to first establish landslide
hazard and vulnerability scenarios for reliable risk
analyses.
Vulnerability to landslides can be evaluated
only if we know the exposure to landslide hazard
and our preparedness to face that hazard.
Vulnerability will be close to nil in the case of
well managed and protected slopes. It will be
the maximum for unprepared populations living
on slopes with a proven history of landslides.
This vulnerability to landslides can be reduced by
creating a culture of safety through careful land
use planning, timely and appropriate engineering
intervention, conscientious maintenance of slopes
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
2
and connected utilities, early warning, public
awareness, and preparedness. We need to develop
a culture of quick response to managing disasters
to reduce the impact of landslide disasters.
Once we know the landslide hazard and
vulnerability profile, specific risk can be determined.
The total risk is then the multiple of the specific risk
(as calculated above) and elements like population,
property, infrastructure, and development activities
exposed to landslide hazards. The main purpose of
this exercise is to visualise a relationship between
landslide hazards, risk, and impact of a landslide,
possibly in terms of quantified loss for safer
construction (See Figure 1.1).
Landslides are a natural hazard that affect at
least 15 per cent of the land area of our country,
covering an area of more than 0.49 million sq.
km. Landslides of different types occur frequently
in the geo-dynamically active domains in the
Himalayan and North-Eastern parts of the country
as well as relatively stable domains in the Western
Ghats and Nilgiri hills in the Southern part of
the country. Besides, sporadic occurrences of
landslides have been reported in the Eastern
Ghats, Ranchi Plateau, and Vindhyan Plateau
as well. In all, 22 States and parts of the Union
Territory of Pudducherry and Andaman & Nicobar
Islands of our country are affected by this hazard,
mostly during the monsoons.

vegetal cover, which has been reduced to less
than 30 per cent, which is less than half of what
would be considered desirable. As the pressure
of population grew rapidly, more and more
human settlements, roads, dams, tunnels, water
reservoirs, towers and other public utilities came
up in vulnerable areas. The road network in the
Himalayan region is more than 50,000 km in
length. A large number of dams have been built
in the Himalayan region.
There are more than 25 river dam projects on
the river Ganga and its tributaries in the hills alone.
A number of tunnels and towers for microwave,
television, and power transmission dot the hilly
areas. Quarrying and mining, for example, in
the Doon valley, Jhiroli (Almora) and Chandhak
(Pithoragarh) have inflicted heavy damages to the
slopes and the associated environment.
The Himalayan mountain ranges and hilly tracts
of the North-Eastern region are highly susceptible
to slope instability due to the immature and rugged
topography, fragile rock conditions, high seismicity
resulting from proximity to the plate margins,
and high rainfall. Extensive anthropogenic
interference, as part of developmental activities,
is another significant factor that increases this
hazard manifold. As a result, the landscape in the
Himalayan and North-Eastern regions is highly
susceptible to reoccurrence of landslides. The
Ambutia landslide, located on the picturesque
tea garden clad hill slopes around the Kurseong
town in Darjeeling is probably the largest such
landslide in Asia.
Similarly, the Western Ghats, overlooking
the Konkan coast, though located in a relatively
stable domain, experience the fury of this natural
hazard due to steep hill slopes,
overburden and high intensity
rainfall. The Nilgiri hills located
at the convergence zone of the
Eastern Ghats and the Western
Ghats bear the innumerable
scars of landslides due to
their location in a zone of high
intensity and protracted rainfall
where overburden is sensitive
to over-saturation.
In addition to landslides,
the snow avalanche is another
natural hazard involving mass
movement that is experienced
at high altitudes in the
Himalayan terrain during the
late winter season when the
snow starts melting.
Vast areas of western
Sikkim, Kumaon, Garhwal,
Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir, and
several other hilly regions have
been denuded of protective

Landslides along the National Highway (NH) 1A
and NH-1B in Jammu and Kashmir, the RishikeshBadrinath pilgrimage route in Uttarakhand,
highways and roads in Darjeeling and Sikkim, and
the Dimapur-Imphal and Shillong-Silchar National
Highways in the North-Eastern region have been
disastrous and have caused immense economic
loss and affected the social fabric for a long time.
Landslides with catastrophic effects include
the Varunavat landslide of Uttarkashi, the Malpa
landslide along the Kailash-Mansarovar yatra
route, the Kaliasaur landslide along the RishikeshBadrinath pilgrimage route, the Zubza and Mao
Seng Song landslides along the Dimapur-Imphal
National Highway, the Sonapur landslide along the
Shillong-Silchar National Highway, the Sakinaka
landslide in Mumbai, the Konkan landslides of
2005, and the Ghanvi village landslide in Himachal
Pradesh in 2007.
Instances of co-seismic landslides particularly
in the Himalayan and North-Eastern parts of our
country are common. The Shillong earthquake of
1897, the Kangra earthquake of 1905, the Assam
earthquake of 1950, the Uttarkashi earthquake
of 1991, and the Chamoli earthquake of 1999
generated numerous landslides over vast areas.
Similarly, the October 2005 Kashmir earthquake
generated numerous landslides in both Pakistani
as well as Indian territory.
In the Western Ghats, over 500 lives were
lost due to landslides in the Konkan area in
Maharashtra during incessant rain in 2005,
which accounted for 100 lives in the Mumbai
Metropolitan Area alone.
Some examples of devastating landslides
in the Nilgiris include the Amboori landslide
in Thiruvanantapuram district, Kerala; and the
Runnymede, Hospital, Glenmore, Coonoor, and
Karadipallam landslides in Nilgiri district, Tamil Nadu.
Some of the landslides block drainage courses
and form natural dams known as landslide dams.
A few such landslide dams worth mentioning are
the Gohana Gad landslide dam that blocked the
river Birehiganga in 1893, the landslide blockage
on the Patalganga river in 1970 which led to the
Alakananda tragedy, the Naptha-Jhakhri landslide
on the Sutlej that caused huge losses to the
Naptha-Jhakhri hydroelectric project, and the
recent landslide that blocked the river Parechhu
in Tibet caused large-scale flooding in Himachal
Pradesh in June, 2005 when this dam was
breached.
The Himalayan and North-Eastern regions are
potential sites where landslide dams have formed
at many places in the past and the potential of such
occurrences in the future is high. In contrast, the
peninsular shield region is tectonically stable and
the potential of occurrences of landslide dams is
very low.
1.3 Impact
Landslide disasters have both short-term and
long-term impact on society and the environment.
The short-term impact accounts for loss of life
and property at the site and the long-term impact
includes changes in the landscape that can be
permanent, including the loss of cultivable land
and the environmental impact in terms of erosion
and soil loss, population shift and relocation of
populations and establishments.
Like in any other disaster, the most affected
are the socio-economically weaker sections of the
society who inhabit the vulnerable areas. They have
meagre sources of livelihood, which when wiped
out by a hazard, leaves them without any food or
shelter. Apart from this, the injuries and casualties
suffered add to the woes of the affected families.
The biggest loss is that of private and government
property, as well as damage to/destruction of
infrastructure and heritage structures.
5
The frequent obstructions caused to the
movement of traffic by numerous landslides
during the rainy season, sometimes for days
together, particularly in the Himalayan and NorthEastern regions of the country, bring untold misery
to the people inhabiting the villages and townships
in the landslide-prone hilly regions.
Landslides also reduce the effective life of,
and returns from hydroelectric and multipurpose
projects by adding an enormous amount of silt
load to the reservoirs.
Landslide dams result in the flooding of large
upstream areas. Further, if the dam fails, it causes
flooding and large scale devastation in downstream
areas. Also, solid landslide debris can ‘bulk’ or add
volume and density to otherwise normal stream
flow or cause channel blockages and diversions
creating flood conditions or localised erosion.
Landslides can also cause overtopping of dams
resulting in flash floods and/or reduced capacity
of reservoirs to store water.
1.4 Landslide Management in India
1.4.1 Current Status
Landslide hazard management in India had
till now been confined to ad-hoc solutions of site
specific problems and the implementation of
immediate remedial measures including debris
removal, and dumping of this debris either down
slope or into a river. The aim of these Guidelines is
to manage landslide hazard through an institutional
mechanism, by following a systematic approach
that includes both short-term and long-term
planning after a study of the hazard, vulnerability
and risk assessment.
Landslide hazard management involves
measures taken to avoid or mitigate the risk
posed by landslide hazards. The most important
role in this process is played by the local
government machinery. Once information is
received about the probability of landslide
occurrence within its jurisdiction, it initiates steps
to warn the communities living in the area about
the risk involved and tries to convince landowners/
dwellers to shift to safer places. Moreover, further
development is avoided in such high risk zones.
Mitigation strategies might not be possible
in every landslide hazard prone area both due
their high cost and the indifferent attitude of the
public. Efforts to reduce risk are also made by
road construction and maintenance agencies by
implementing required treatment measures.
There is, however, a need to pre-empt disaster
by making adequate information available in
advance before it strikes, something that is
emphasised in these Guidelines which are to be
used by all states, especially those affected by
multi-hazards.
1.4.2 Government Policies and Initiatives
The Government of India (GoI) has been quite
concerned about the management of natural
calamities since a long time. The task of Disaster
Management (DM) was earlier entrusted to the
Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) since only droughts
and floods were considered major national natural
calamities. Here too, the main focus was on postdisaster response i.e., conducting relief operations
in the affected areas.
The devastating Malpa tragedy resulting
from a landslide that occurred along the KailashMansarovar route in the Kumaon Himalayan region
in August 1998 acted as an eye-opener for the
GoI as far as landslide disasters are concerned. It
decided to set up task forces for Landslide Hazard
Zonation (LHZ), Geotechnical Investigations
and Land Use Zonation and Regulation. The
Geological Survey of India (GSI) was identified as
the nodal agency for LHZ while the Department of
Science and Technology (DST) and the Ministry of
The Context
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
6
Environment and Forests (MoEF) were identified
as nodal agencies for the other two task forces,
respectively. Consequently, the Department of
Mines (DoM) constituted a task force to review the
existing methodologies for LHZ study, to prioritise
areas/belts for its study and to recommend a
plan for the preparation of macro/meso/micro
LHZ maps. The task force constituted by the
DoM submitted its report to the Government in
September 2000.
The DST pursued the task on Geotechnical
Investigations and submitted a report to the
Government. The DST launched the Coordinated
National Programme on Landslide Hazard
Mitigation and published a document on the
Status of Activities and Thrust Areas of Research
in December 2003. Several projects have been
sanctioned by the DST since then.
The GSI is the nodal agency for monitoring
landslide activity and its mitigation.
There are many government departments
and organisations which are engaged in landslide
hazard studies and hazard management in the
country. These include the GSI, Central Road
Research Institute (CRRI), Central Building
Research Institute (CBRI), Indian Institute of
Technology, Roorkee (IIT-R), Wadia Institute of
Himalayan Geology (WIHG), Department of Space
(DoS), National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC),
Defence Terrain Research Laboratory (DTRL),
Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), some academic
institutions, and individual experts. The Snow and
Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) under
the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is the institution
engaged in studying snow avalanches. In addition,
the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is the
principal agency responsible for the construction
and maintenance of roads in almost all the hilly
regions of the country and DST has been funding
Research and Development (R&D) activities that
include different types of landslide investigations.
The earliest landslide studies in the country
were carried out by the GSI. This includes the
study of the Nainital landslide by Sir R.D. Oldham
in 1880 and C.S. Middlemiss in 1890, and the study
of the Gohana landslide in 1893 in the erstwhile
Uttar Pradesh Himalayan region that resulted in the
formation of a 350m high landslide dam across the
Birehiganga. Till date the Department has carried
out studies on more than 1,500 incidences of
landslides. In the case of LHZ mapping, the GSI
has prepared LHZ maps with scales of 1:50,000
and 1:25,000 covering about 45,000 sq. km in
the landslide prone hilly tracts. LHZ mapping has
also been carried out with similar scales, covering
about 4,000 km along the important national
and state highways. Besides, the GSI has also
prepared detailed LHZ maps of five landslide
affected townships in different parts of the country
at scales of 1:5,000 and 1:10,000.
Facet based LHZ methodology was initiated at
the University of Roorkee (now the Indian Institute
of Technology) in the mid-eighties. The work is still
continuing over different parts of the Uttarakhand
Himalayan region, incorporating progressive
improvements. Several institutions have adopted
facet based LHZ mapping.
The CRRI’s major activities include geological
and geotechnical investigations of landslides,
landslide hazard potential and risk analysis,
instrumentation, monitoring, and prevention of
landslides. The CRRI has published reports on
landslide correction techniques, application of
geo-textiles, deep trench drains, and promotion
of jute based geo-textiles, etc. The CRRI has also
prepared a partial database of over 200 landslides
in different parts of the country.
The CBRI has prepared LHZ maps in parts of
Garhwal, Sikkim, and the Darjeeling Himalayan
region using different techniques and has also
monitored some landslides. The institute has also
implemented control measures at the Mussoorie
7
bypass and the Kaliasaur landslides in the state
of Uttarakhand.
The Central Scientific Instrumentation
Organisation (CSIO), a national instrumentation
laboratory, has installed an instrumentation
network for landslide monitoring at Mansa Devi,
Haridwar in 2006.
The WIHG has carried out LHZ mapping in
parts of the Sutlej valley and has also monitored
some landslides.
The BIS has the responsibility of developing
zoning codes and guidelines related to landslide
practices. It has issued guidelines related to LHZ
mapping on macro-scales, construction of retaining
walls and landslide control. For standardising
landslide studies BIS is also in the process of
developing LHZ mapping guidelines on meso
scale, risk evaluation and detailed investigations.
The Landslide Hazard Atlas of India containing
small scale maps was published jointly by the
Building Materials and Technology Promotion
Council (BMTPC) and Anna University in 2004.
The NRSC has prepared LHZ maps on a scale
of 1:25,000 along various pilgrimage routes and
important highways in Uttarakhand and the Himachal
Himalayan region. Utilisation of the latest available
remote sensing techniques and synthesisation of
data on the (Geographic Information System) GIS
platform were the highlights of the work. The NRSC
published a two volume atlas on LHZ in 2004. The
NRSC has also carried out a high resolution aerial
survey of the Varunwat landslide and has provided
detailed maps on the contour, slope, etc. The
NRSC, GSI and International Institute for GeoInformation Science and Earth Observation (ITC)
are collaborating on developing landslide risk
assessment models for the North-Western and
North-Eastern Himalayan regions and also the
Western Ghats. A collaborative project on LHZ
for NH-17 (from Mumbai to Goa) by the GSI and
NRSC is in progress.
With the availability of high resolution images,
it is possible for the NRSC to monitor landslides
and also keep an eye on the occurrence of new
landslides and formation of landslide dams in
highly inaccessible areas.
The National Institute of Disaster Management
(NIDM), which works under the control of
the National Disaster Management Authority
(NDMA), has the capability to develop training
modules, formulate and implement human
resource development plans, organise training
programmes covering the management of natural
hazards including landslides, develop educational
material for DM, and provide assistance to state
governments and state training institutes in the
formulation of state level policies and plans for DM.
The DST has been carrying out a number of
activities related to landslide management for
the past 15 years. It carried out landslide hazard
mapping in parts of the Sutlej Valley in Himachal
Pradesh, the Kumaon and Garhwal areas in
Uttarakhand, the Konkan Railway Region from
Panvel to Ratnagiri, the Nilgiris, and the NorthEastern states of Manipur, Nagaland, Mizoram,
Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh. The data/maps are
in digital form and can be shared for DM activities.
The DST has also developed software/brochures
for the Landslide Safe Route Finder to provide safe
navigation while constructing new communication
lines/roads in hilly areas.
The DST has brought out many publications on
landslides and related issues like the coordinated
national programme on Landslide Hazard
Mitigation, and a Field Manual for Landslide
Investigations, etc. Periodically, it also organises
awareness programmes/courses/workshops
for government agencies/Non-Governmental
Organisations (NGOs) and communities.

In collaboration with the International Centre
for Geohazards and the Norwegian Geotechnical
Institute, the DST is establishing a National
Geotechnical Facility (NGF) in Dehradun. The
NGF aims to have state-of-the-art facilities in
geotechnical sciences and to provide a platform for
building capacities in geotechnical investigations
and research. This will also help in networking the
institutions within the country which have facilities
and technical manpower. It is expected that the
NGF will provide inputs for DM related activities
in designing/retrofitting underground and surface
level structures.
The Central Water Commission (CWC) has been
the lead agency for assessing the hazard potential
of landslide dams in the country and its vicinity.
1.4.3 Landslide Studies—Methods Practiced
in India
Landslide Hazard Zonation Mapping
LHZ mapping is a tool to identify those areas
which are, or could be, affected by landslides
and assessing the probability of such landslides
occurring within a specified period of time. The
preparation of a LHZ map includes the study of
the regional geology and geomorphic setting,
slope conditions including existing and potential
instability, and land use information. Scale is
an important factor of LHZ mapping. Maps of
1:1,00,000 or 1:50,000 scales are inappropriate
for regional studies since these are only indicative
and do not provide adequate details. Larger scale
maps on 1:10,000 or 1:5,000 scale are taken up
for detailed studies at the local level.
Inventory of Landslide Incidences
Unlike earthquakes or floods, landslides are
localised events. But these may occur with a high
frequency in a region. The basic objective for the
preparation of a LHZ map is the availability of
a landslide inventory database which indicates
the intensity of the hazard in a given area. The
preparation of landslide inventory maps and
databases is a tedious procedure. A landslide
inventory database requires detailed information,
both present and past, about a landslide. Thus,
it is very difficult to obtain a complete landslide
inventory map containing information like the type
and characteristics of slope failure, exact date
of occurrence, triggering event that initiated the
movement, etc. This lack of landslide inventory
data leads to problems in validating landslide
hazard maps. No organisation in our country has
a sound database on landslide inventory. Taking
into consideration the importance of developing
a sound database on landslide inventory, the
GSI has recently initiated a programme for the
generation of landslide inventory maps and
databases covering the landslide prone regions
of our country. These can be supplemented using
satellite data for updating the information and
plotting in the geospatial domain.
Site Specific Study of Landslides
The purpose of site specific studies is to
investigate a landslide in detail, employing both
surface and sub-surface exploration techniques
to establish the type of slide, causative factors
leading to slope instability, stability status of the
slope, monitoring of the slide to understand its
dynamic behaviour, the extent of damages caused
and likely to be caused due to further sliding, the
mechanism of sliding and finally to suggest the
most appropriate corrective measures to stabilise
the slide. Geotechnical investigations, including
monitoring, have been carried out at some of the
landslides. These include work on the Kaliasaur
landslide along NH-58 near Srinagar, the Nainital
landslide at Sher Ka Danda and 9.5 Mile, B2 and
Lanta Khola landslides in Sikkim, the Powari
landslide at km 367 on NH-21, Kinnaur district,
Himachal Pradesh, and the Patalganga landslide
on NH-58 near Pipalkoti, Uttarakhand. The DST has
9
initiated various research projects such as the ones
for NH-1A Sonapur in Meghalaya, the Tirumala Hills,
eight specific sites in Uttarakhand, etc.
Rock fall velocity modelling is a new kind of
study for which very limited research has been
done in the country. IIT-R has recently attempted
it in the Nandprayag region in the Garhwal
Himalayas. The velocity of a rock fall is one of
the main factors which defines the degree of
the risk. Slow moving landslides are not as risky,
if the movement is continuous. However rock
falls are one type of landslide that need to be
understood with respect to their movement i.e.,
slow or fast and also with respect to the risks they
cause to the local population. For rock fall velocity
modelling, software needs to be developed and
tested on accessible slopes for further research
and modifications.
Research and Development
A number of organisations/institutes in India
are engaged in studies of the different aspects
of landslides. However, very little effort towards
R&D pertaining to landslide investigation has
been made so far in India. Intensive research is
urgently required in order to develop innovative,
eco-friendly and cost-effective measures for
landslide investigation and remediation practices.
These include the standardisation of landslide
terminologies, methods of slope stability analysis,
standardisation of guidelines for landslide hazard
zonation mapping on different scales, procedure of
vulnerability and risk evaluation and assessment,
preparation of guidelines for risk zonation
mapping, innovative techniques and/or modern
technology for the construction of underground
drainage networks, etc.
Snow Avalanches Studies
Snow avalanches are not landslides in a strict
sense of the term, but when snow and ice slides
The Context
it causes devastation, especially during inclement
weather at high altitudes. Snow avalanches lead to
disasters in the snow covered mountainous terrain
of the Himalayas. Avalanches are transient, three
dimensional, gravity driven, free surface, rapidly
moving shear flows that contain a dense granular
core surrounded by a cloud of airborne turbulent
powder. The SASE is engaged in carrying out
research activities in the field of snow avalanche
forecasting and avalanche control structures. The
SASE is also responsible for conducting search
and rescue operations as post-disaster activities
in the case of snow avalanches.
1.4.4 Landslide Remediation Practices
A comprehensive risk management strategy
requires systematic approaches in planning and
implementation. It includes two main categories,
i.e., pre-disaster prevention strategies and postdisaster management. Pre-disaster strategies
include assessment of the hazard, risk analysis
through the documentation of existing events,
hazard zonation mapping and the application of
modern techniques that can help in preventing the
activation of dangerous processes. Comprehensive
hazard zonation aims at preventing settlements
and infrastructural elements from being located
in vulnerable areas and also prescribing, to some
extent, the appropriate treatment measures
required at vulnerable locations.
Remediation practices, including slope
geometry correction, providing protection to the
toe of slope by retaining structures, management
of the surface and sub-surface water including
the development of pore pressures, nailing,
bolting, anchoring, micro piling, application of
geo-grids and geo-textiles and afforestation,
constitute powerful elements of most geotechnical packages commonly used for improving
the stability of problematic slopes and landslide
sites in India.
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
10
In India, most landslides occur during the
monsoon barring a few, which are caused by
earthquakes. Pore water pressure plays a major
role in initiating landslide events. There are also
instances where toe erosion by rivers or nalas
and scouring of the hill slope due to high velocity
discharge of streams descending from the
crown of the landslide gives rise to debris flows/
landslides. Hence, surface and sub-surface water
management on the slopes or in the catchments
is the most effective remediation measure for
controlling many landslides. Management of
surface runoff and sub-surface water is done
through the construction of drainage networks.
Sub-surface drainage management is hardly
practiced in our country for the stabilisation of
landslides. This aspect of prevention calls for
immediate attention and agencies like the BRO,
Public Works Department (PWDs), etc., engaged
in slope stabilisation activities need to be equipped
with modern technologies for the construction of
sub-surface drainage networks.
Reinforcing technologies like nailing, bolting,
anchoring and tie-back solutions have all provided
apt solutions to a wide range of civil and mining
engineering problems. Numerous successful
examples of stabilisation of problematic slopes,
landslides, open cast mines, tunnels, road
cuttings, etc., bear ample testimony to the
potential of reinforcing technologies.
Technological interventions in many cases
have not been sensitive to the needs of specific
sites, and there has been very little technological
innovation in India in the area of landslide control.
These shortcomings can be overcome only
through R&D efforts in technological intervention
by knowledge based institutions or organisations.
1.4.5 Slope Instrumentation, Monitoring and
Landslide Prediction
Slope instrumentation for the monitoring
and prediction of landslides has so far generally
not been practiced in India. A few attempts
have been made by some institutions but the
methodology and techniques as well as the results
are not uniform. Detailed slope stability analysis
and landslide modelling are almost impossible
without slope instrumentation generated data.
Monitoring indicates the acceleration of movement
and the development of pore pressures at
different locations within the landslide mass.
However, interpretation of the data is difficult
as critical values are unknown in the absence of
a documented history of previous events. It is
also not practicable to monitor all landslides by
the installation of instruments, considering the
prohibitive cost and the huge number of landslide
incidences in the country. The monitoring system
of landslides can, however, be used for warning
people about ensuing disaster.
1.5 Early Warning Systems for
Landslides
Early warning systems elsewhere in the world
have been developed by the real-time monitoring
of landslides. This includes the continuous
monitoring of movements, development of
stresses, and pore pressures or hydrostatic
pressures, and the transmission of this instrument
generated data through a telemetric system
at regular time intervals. At the initiation of
an event, radio signals are transmitted and
alarm signals are sent to the relevant authority
regarding the impending danger and probable
time of occurrence of a landslide. However,
awareness generation and the involvement of
local communities is a vital component of an early
warning system, to ensure its success. Thus, in
certain cases, the local communities, if properly
trained and adequately motivated, can observe the
movement indicators on the hill slopes and issue
the necessary warnings.
Real-time monitoring may be undertaken for
the development of an early warning system in the
11
case of a few devastating, large dimension and
recurring types of slides or rock falls which are very
difficult to stabilise and pose a high risk. Since the
ultimate goal is to find a permanent solution, i.e.,
to stabilise the landslide, the development of an
early warning system is not the ultimate answer
to this natural hazard, but only a part of the effort
to mitigate its impact.
Considering the probable danger of losing
instruments due to the recurrent nature of
some of the conspicuous landslides and the
prohibitively high cost of these instruments, an
effort should be made to develop an early warning
system for some of the devastating landslides
where instrumentation could be proposed that
would serve the twin purposes of providing a
detailed slope stability analysis for suggesting
the most appropriate remedial measures, or the
development of an early warning system by the
real-time monitoring of these landslides. The
experience gained from this type of exercise will
be immensely helpful for studying other landslides.
1.6 Landslide Education, Awareness
and Capacity Building
The GoI has initiated a nation-wide awareness
generation campaign as a part of its overall disaster
risk management strategy. A steering committee
for a mass media campaign has been constituted
at the national level with due representation of
experts from diverse communications streams.
DM as a subject, including landslides, has been
introduced in the school Social Science curriculum
for classes VIII, IX and X by the Central Board of
Secondary Education (CBSE) in all the schools
affiliated to it. The same is to be done by state
boards of secondary education in all disaster prone
states. While the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)
has compiled/prepared a set of resource materials
on some natural hazards—developed by various
organisations/institutions—for distribution and
dissemination, there is an urgent requirement to
develop resource materials for landslide hazards
as well.
As a part of the awareness generation exercise
for the landslide hazard mitigation effort, the GSI, in
consultation with the MHA, initiated a programme
to establish contact with various state governments
in landslide affected areas and to create awareness
about this hazard among the state officers and other
agencies dealing with natural hazards. The contact
programme in the form of a one-day interactive
workshop has so far been conducted in the states
of Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir,
Assam, Meghalaya, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Tripura,
Nagaland, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, and the Union
Territory of Pudducherry. The programme consists
of an audio-visual presentation and distribution
of booklets and posters for creating awareness
about landslide hazards, terminologies, causes,
treatment measures, etc.
Another effort in landslide education involves
the development of self-training software and selfcertification CD-ROMS. Such efforts to produce
quality resource materials are to be an ongoing
process. The GSI Training Institute conducts a
regular training programme on the various aspects
of landslide investigations using state-of-the-art
technologies.
The NIDM has the mandate to develop training
modules, undertake research and documentation
for DM, provide assistance in national and state
level policy formulation, develop educational
materials for DM, and promote awareness about
hazard mitigation, preparedness, and response
measures. The Indian Institute of Remote Sensing
(IIRS), Dehradun also conducts courses, both
short- and long-term, in the use of remote sensing
data for geological hazards. The decision support
centre at the NRSC also conducts a two-week
course for various planners at the state and district
level in the use of Earth Observations (EO) data
for hazards.
The Context
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
12
The mass awareness generation programme
is to be made an essential component of the
disaster mitigation plan and is to be carried out
in a sustained manner through the electronic and
print media, interactive meets, and the distribution
of handbills and posters in local languages, with
the help of different NGOs and state government
authorities. For this purpose a series of audiovisual resource materials has to be prepared and
distributed to these organisations, for which the
services of the media, private volunteers and
NGOs active in the field of DM can be effectively
utilised, after proper orientation.
A large number of engineers and geologists
engaged in landslide hazard management do not
possess the requisite expertise to manage this
hazard. Therefore, landslide hazard management
techniques, risk assessment and remediation
practices are required to be included in the
curricula of technical institutes teaching civil
engineering, geology, geophysics and DM.
Professionals engaged in Landslide Hazard
Management (LHM) have to be properly oriented
and made aware about the latest technological
developments related to landslides. Some training
institutes need to be identified and entrusted with
the responsibility of regularly training and orienting
professionals.
1.7 The Snow Avalanche Hazard
1.7.1 Introduction
The snow avalanche, a common occurrence in
snow covered mountainous regions, is a slide of
snow mass down a mountainside. This is a rapid
downslope movement of a large detached mass
of snow, ice, and associated debris such as rocks
and vegetation. Small avalanches, or sluffs, occur
in large numbers, while large avalanches that may
encompass slopes a kilometre or more in length
with millions of tons of snow, occur infrequently
but cause most of the damage. Humans have been
exposed to the threat of sliding snow for as long as
they have inhabited mountainous regions. A large
avalanche can run for many kilometres, and result
in massive destruction of forests and anything else
that comes in its way.
These threats are felt in the Indian context
as well. Most recently, snowfall of up to 2m
occurred at many places on the higher reaches
of the Pir Panjal range between 16–20 February
2005, resulting in avalanches at several places
in Anantnag, Doda, Poonch, Pulwama, and
Udhampur districts of Jammu and Kashmir. Over
300 people lost their lives.
1.7.2 Types of Avalanches
There are two basic types of avalanches, loose
snow avalanches and slab avalanches. These
are further sub-divided according to whether the
snow involved is dry, damp or wet, whether the
snowslide originates in a surface layer or involves
the whole snow cover (slides to the ground), and
whether the motion is on the ground, in the air,
or mixed.
Loose snow avalanches form in snow masses
with little internal cohesion among the individual
snow crystals. When such snow lies in a state of
unstable equilibrium on a slope steeper than its
natural angle of repose, a slight disturbance sets
progressively more and more snow in downhill
motion. If enough momentum is generated, the
sliding snow may run out onto level ground, or
even ascend an opposite valley slope. Such an
avalanche originates at a point and grows wider
as it sweeps up more snow in its descent. The
demarcation between sliding and undisturbed
snow is diffuse, especially in dry snow. Though
very common, most dry, loose snow avalanches
are small and few achieve sufficient size to cause
damage. With the onset of melting, wet loose
snow avalanches become common. Most of the
13
latter, too, are small, but they are more likely to
occasionally reach destructive size, especially
when confined to a gulley.
Slab avalanches originate in snow with
sufficient internal cohesion to enable a snow layer,
or layers, to react mechanically as a single entity.
The degree of this required cohesion may range
from very slight in fresh, new snow (soft slab) to
very high in hard, wind drifted snow (hard slab). A
slab avalanche breaks free along a characteristic
fracture line, a sharp division of sliding from
stable snow whose face stands perpendicular to
the slope. The entire surface of unstable snow is
set in motion at the same time, especially when
the cohesive snow lies on top of a weak layer.
A slab release may take place across an entire
mountainside, with the fracture racing from
slope to slope to adjacent or even distant slide
paths. The mechanical conditions leading to slab
avalanche formation are found in a wide variety of
snow types, new and old, dry and wet. They may
be induced by the nature of snow deposition (wind
drifting is the prime agent of slab formation), or
by internal metamorphism. Slab avalanches are
often dangerous, unpredictable in behaviour, and
account for most of the damage.
Avalanches composed of dry snow usually
generate a dust cloud when the sliding snow is
whirled into the air. Such slides, called powder
snow avalanches, most frequently originate as soft
slabs. Under favourable circumstances, enough
snow crystals are mixed with the air to form an
aerosol which behaves as a sharply bounded body
of dense gas rushing down the slope ahead of
the sliding snow. This wind blast can achieve high
velocities, to inflict heavy destruction well beyond
the normal bounds of the avalanche path.
Wet snow avalanches move more slowly
than dry ones and are seldom accompanied by
dust clouds. Their higher snow density can lend
them enormous destructive force in spite of lower
velocities. As wet slides reach their deposition
zones, the interaction of sliding and stagnated
snow produces a characteristic channelling.
Direct action avalanches are the immediate
result of a single snow storm. They usually involve
only fresh snow. Climax avalanches are caused by a
series of snow storms or a culmination of weather
influences. Their fall is not necessarily associated
with a current storm or weather situation.
1.7.3 Causes of Snow Avalanches
Avalanches form as soon as the force of
gravity on the snow cover exceeds its mechanical
strength. To be caused, an avalanches needs a
steep slope, snow cover, a weak layer in the snow
cover, and a trigger to initiate movement. Snow
avalanches may occur on any slope where enough
snow is deposited in the right circumstances.
Snow does not accumulate significantly on
steep slopes; also, snow does not flow easily on
flat slopes. Most avalanches of dangerous size
therefore originate on slopes with inclinations of
between 30 degrees and 45 degrees. On slopes
from 45 degrees to 50 degrees, sluffs and small
avalanches are common, but snow seldom
accumulates to sufficient depths to generate large
snow slides. Convex slopes are more susceptible
to avalanches than concave slopes.
Avalanches are released (spontaneously or
artificially) by an increase in stress (e.g., by fresh
snow) and/or a decrease in strength (e.g., by
warming or rain). Though internal metamorphism
or stress development may sometimes initiate
a snow rupture, avalanches are often dislodged
by external triggers. Ice fall, falling cornices,
earthquakes, rock falls, thermal changes, blizzards,
and even other avalanches are common natural
triggers. Avalanches can also be triggered by
loud sounds such as shouts, machine noise,
and sonic booms. In the absence of external
triggers, unstable snow may revert to stability
The Context
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
14
with the passage of time as long as no avalanche
occurs. The rheology of snow cover is similar to
that of ice as both are visco-elastic materials that
exhibit creep behaviour over time. Snow deforms
continually without fracturing as the load on top of
it increases. However, the loading rate is critical.
Heavy snow fall over a short duration leads to a
greater probability of avalanche occurrence. A
snow fall of 1m in one day is far more hazardous
than 1m over three days.
When the snow pack becomes unstable,
it is released suddenly and descends rapidly
downslope, either over a wide area or concentrated
in an avalanche track. Avalanches reach speeds of
up to 200 km an hour and can exert forces great
enough to destroy structures coming in their
way and uproot or snap off large trees. It may be
preceded by an ‘air blast’ capable of damaging
constructions and forest cover.
The complete path of an avalanche is made
up of a starting zone at the top where the unstable
snow breaks away from the more stable part of the
snow cover, a run-out zone at the bottom where
the moving snow and entrained debris stop, and
a track that runs between the two zones. The
air blast zone is usually in the vicinity, but not
necessarily continuous with the lower track or
run-out zone. In some cases it may even run way
up the slope across the valley from the avalanche
path.
In general the run-out zone is the critical area
for land use decisions because of its otherwise
attractive setting for development. Avalanches
run on the same paths year after year, the
danger zones often being well known in normal
circumstances. Exceptionally uneventful weather
intervals lasting for many years may produce
exceptional avalanches which overrun their normal
paths and even break new ones where none
existed for centuries. Avalanche prone lands may
pass many winters or even decades without a
serious avalanche.
Avalanches are not confined to specific terrain
features: they may follow narrow gullies or ravines
for all or a part of their path, they may occur on
broad, uniform slopes or even ridges and spurs.
The longitudinal profiles of the paths may be
concave, convex, or stepped. On stepped paths,
small avalanches will often stop on a bench some
distance down the tract while larger ones will run
the full length of the path.
1.7.4 The Impact of Snow Avalanches
The forces generated by moderate or large
avalanches can damage or destroy most manmade structures. The debris from even small
avalanches is enough to block a highway or
rail-road. Avalanches are extremely destructive
due to the great impact forces of the rapidly
moving snow and debris and the burial of areas
in the run-out zone. Structures not specifically
designed to withstand these impacts are generally
totally destroyed. Where avalanches cross
highways, passing vehicles can be swept away
and destroyed, killing their occupants.
In general, land use within an avalanche
area should not include buildings intended for
winter and early spring occupancy. Ordinarily,
use of avalanche areas in the summer does not
constitute any hazard. Structures including power
lines, highways, railroads, and other facilities that
are placed in avalanche paths and run-out zones
should be designed for expected impact even if
other preventive measures are implemented.
1.7.5 Early Warning Systems against Snow
Avalanche Hazards
There are two basic methods of anticipating
an avalanche hazard. One is the examination of the
snow cover structure for patterns of weakness,
particularly those leading to slab avalanches.
The second method is the analysis of the
meteorological factors affecting snow depositions.
In practice the two methods overlap and both
15
are used. Emphasis on either one or the other
depends on the local climate, pattern of snowfall,
snow type, and avalanche characteristics. Both
apply principally to winter avalanches in dry snow.
Forecasting wet spring avalanches depends on
knowledge of the heat input to the snow surface.
Rising temperature during a storm
accompanied by rising new snow density tends
to cause avalanching, while falling temperatures
have the opposite effect. New snow precipitation
intensity is a significant factor, as it represents the
rate at which the slopes are being overloaded.
Wet snow avalanches are generated by the
intrusion of percolating water (rain or snow melt)
in the snow cover. The rapid rise in temperature
quickly alters snow behaviour, while the water
itself reduces snow strength. Water accumulating
on an impervious crust provides an especially
good lubricating layer for slab release. The most
extensive wet snow avalanching occurs during
winter rains or the first prolonged melt period in
spring, when water intrudes into previously subfreezing snow. Snowmelt due to solar radiation is
the most common cause of wet snow avalanches.
Snow cover, terrain and atmospheric
parameters are the major inputs for forecasting
of snow avalanches. It is difficult to obtain the
required information from the remote regions
of the Himalayas using conventional ground
based techniques, as there are several limitations
due to the inaccessibility and ruggedness of
the terrain, the lack of infrastructure facilities,
and limited information on the region. Satellite
remote sensing is the most efficient tool for these
purposes, especially for large, rugged, and remote
areas. For gathering the latest terrain information
on avalanche-prone areas, snow cover and
atmospheric parameters, optical [MODIS, AVHRR,
AWiFS, WiFS, LISS-III, PAN, Cartographic Satellite
(CARTOSAT), IKONOS, Quickbird] and microwave
(AMSR-E, SSM/I, Radarsat, ENVISAT) imagery can
be used. The latter is useful in weather conditions
where cloud cover obstructs remote observation
by other means.
1.7.6 Avalanche Control Strategies
The need for study of snow bound areas
has increased manifold with the increasing
necessity of developing communication routes,
development of winter tourism, construction of
hydroelectric projects and transmission lines in
snow bound areas. Snow avalanches have long
posed a threat to the indigenous populations of the
Himalayan and Trans-Himalayan mountains. Land
use intensification due to population growth, new
transportation routes, defence related activities
and tourism are raising this level of risk.
Obviously, the most desirable and effective
protection against avalanches is to situate
buildings, roads, and other valuable developmental
projects in areas free from avalanches. However, as
the population grows and more hazardous sites are
considered for development, advanced planning
and strictly enforced zoning and construction
practices appear to be the best solutions. In some
cases, even these are not adequate to completely
eliminate the risk of avalanches, and acceptable
risks must be defined, especially in the case of
roads, power lines and railroads. These risks can,
however, be reduced considerably if appropriate
structural controls are employed.
Since avalanche prone areas can be identified,
the safest and probably best mitigation procedure
is to avoid construction of buildings or any type
of structure involving winter use in these areas.
Agricultural and recreational activities that
take place during the non-avalanche months
are relatively safe. Other uses that could be
considered are those that do not involve permanent
unprotected structures in the avalanche path or
those that could be moved or closed down during
high avalanche-risk periods.
The Context

16
Methods of avalanche control include
structural terrain modification to deflect the sliding
snow away from the fixed facilities to be protected,
or to actually prevent the avalanche release, and
the planned release of small snow slides with
explosives before snow accumulation increases
their destructive potential to unmanageable
proportions.
Explosive techniques have been used for the
deliberate release of avalanches for many years.
The theory behind this technique is to cause
many smaller, controlled avalanches and thus
avoid large unpredictable destructive avalanches.
Explosive control has been very effective in areas
with easy access to avalanche starting zones and
ones that can tolerate many small snow slides
without causing damage. Detailed information
in the form of an inventory on current and past
snow-packs and avalanche conditions should
be made available for this technique to be safe
and effective. However, explosive control may be
unfeasible in areas with human habitation.
Engineering structures for the control of snow
avalanches are of the following four types:
i) Supporting structures in the starting zone
built on the upper part of the avalanche
path to prevent avalanches from initiating,
or to retard movement before it gains
momentum. Massive earth or stone
walls and terraces; rigid structures
made from wood, steel, aluminium, prestressed concrete, or a combination of
these materials; and flexible supporting
structures called ‘snow nets’ constructed
of steel cables or nylon straps and held up
by steel poles, are examples of these.
ii) Deflecting and retarding structures in the
run-out zone to keep the moving snow of an
avalanche away from structures in critical
locations. These are massive structures
usually made of earth, rock, or concrete
located in or near the avalanche track or
run-out zone.
iii) Retarding structures are usually earth
mounds or large concrete structures
called breakers or tripods. The additional
roughness and cross currents set up by
these structures usually stop all but large,
dry snow avalanches.
iv) Direct protection structures are built
immediately adjacent to the object to be
protected, or in a few cases, incorporated
into the design of the object itself. Avalanche
sheds or shelters are merely roofs over
roads or railroads that allow avalanches to
cross the road/railroad without interrupting
or threatening the traffic.
In actual practice it is common for many
different types of structures to be used on a
single path.
In India, the responsibility of dealing with the
different aspects of avalanches rests with the
SASE. The BRO, with a vast network of roads in the
high altitude snow-bound areas of Leh in Jammu
and Kashmir, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal
Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, plays a major role in
the operation of snow-avalanche clearance. The
BRO strives to keep vital lines of communication
open in these snow-bound regions through a
slew of measures like the use of modern snow
cutting equipment/snow cutters/snow sweepers,
conventional dozers, experienced work-force, total
station survey instruments, etc. Summer snow
clearance is carried out every year on a 50 km
stretch across the Zojilla-Pass on the Srinagar-Leh
road (the approximate road length that remains
closed to traffic from mid-November to mid-May
every year) and on a 100 km stretch on the ManaliLeh road across the Rohtang Pass and Baralachla
Pass. These two routes have many avalanche
prone zones, which are cleared with the utmost
caution. In addition, it clears the Khardungla Pass
17
at an altitude of 18,300 ft in the Ladakh region,
the Nathula Pass in Sikkim, and numerous other
passes in the Great Himalayas.
Moreover the BRO keeps a record of these
avalanche zones and appraises the SASE about
the fresh occurrence of avalanches.
The SASE and BRO will be responsible for the
identification and monitoring of snow avalanches.
The SASE will be responsible for the zonation
of avalanche prone areas and the forecasting of
snow avalanches. Central and state governments
in association with the BRO will be responsible
for implementing clearance and control strategies
against identified snow avalanches.

the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and

government, and state governments.]
1.7.7 Search and Rescue Operations for
Snow Avalanches
Search and rescue operations mean either
externally organised search and rescue services
or the capabilities the affected group itself has for
dealing with an avalanche emergency. The latter is
known as self-rescue or companion rescue.
Even small avalanches can present a serious
threat to life. As per the data available, between
55 and 65 per cent of victims buried in snow
avalanches are killed and only 80 per cent of the
victims remaining on the surface survive. Research
indicates that the percentage of survivors depends
on the response times. It varies from 92 per cent
for a response times of 15 minutes to only 30 per
cent for a response time of more than 35 minutes,
as most of the victims die of suffocation. After
two hours, most of the victims die of injuries or
hypothermia.
In snow avalanches, the survivors among the
victims are the first responders. For this reason,
self-rescue or companion rescue is vital, more so
since organised help takes time to arrive.
The chances of a buried victim being found
alive and being rescued increase when victims
carry and use standard avalanche equipment.
The equipment used in Western countries include
avalanche cords, beacons, probes, shovels and
other devices like Emergency Position-Indicating
Radio Beacons (EPIRB) containing the Global
Positioning System (GPS), and mobile phones. A
first aid kit and equipment is useful for assisting
survivors who may have cuts, broken bones, or
other injuries, in addition to hypothermia.
The SASE is presently not involved in carrying
out search and rescue operations. Therefore, the
district administration will identify organisations/
institutions that can take up programmes to
educate the communities living in avalanche prone
areas, to prepare them with the latest techniques
of self-survival, and to equip them with simple
and essential tools. Similarly, the organisations
engaged in development and strategic tasks at
high altitudes will be educated on initial search and
rescue operations and the use of basic equipment
necessary for these operations.
 Quick Response Teams (QRTs) equipped with
the latest rescue equipment like snow clearing
tools, probes, communication capability, and
medical emergency aids will be organised. These
teams will have the capability to be mobilised at
very short notice and reach the affected sites
within the shortest possible time. The QRTs shall
include trained personnel drawn from different
arms of the local administration and the National
Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

1.7.9 Frequency and Intensity of Landslides
The Core Group noted that there are many
similarities in the factors leading to the occurrence,
as also the different aspects in the management of
landslides and avalanches. Also, the geographical
spread, frequency and intensity of landslide
occurrence is substantially greater than that of
avalanches. It was therefore felt that the preceding
coverage of the avalanche hazard could be read
together with the rest of this document, with the
understanding that, largely, the applicability of the
recommendations may be taken as equal for both
phenomena.
1.8 Recent Government Initiatives
The GoI has taken serious notice of the loss
of life and property due to natural calamities. A
review of the DM mechanism was carried out by
the GoI after the Super Cyclone in Orissa in 1999
and the Kutch Earthquake in Gujarat in 2001. It was
then decided to shift the subject of DM from the
MoA to MHA, and the actual transfer took place in
June 2002. Feeling the need for including hazard
mitigation activities in the planning process for
sustainable development, the GoI decided to bring
about a paradigm shift in policy from relief-centric
activities to an emphasis on mitigation, prevention,
and preparedness as essential components in
the DM process. A strategic roadmap has been
drawn up for reducing the country’s vulnerability
to disasters and this roadmap shall be reviewed
every two years. The GoI constituted a number of
committees in order to assess the hazards and their
risks; to develop early warning systems; to evolve
techniques for hazard mitigation; to generate
public awareness about the causes, effects, and
safety measures to be adopted; and to undertake
rescue, relief, and rehabilitation measures. At the
national level, the MHA was declared as the nodal
ministry for the coordination of relief, response
and overall DM, and the GSI was declared as
the nodal agency for landslides by the GoI in
January 2004. Accordingly, the Action Plan on
Landslide Hazard Risk Mitigation was formulated
by the MHA, and the GSI started implementing
it. Subsequently, the Disaster Management Act,
2005, (DM Act) was enacted on 23 December
2005, and the government set up the NDMA, a
statutory body under the chairmanship of the
Prime Minister. While the responsibility of coping
with natural disasters is essentially that of the
state government, the central government plays
a supportive role in terms of the supplementation
of physical and financial resources. At the state
level, almost all state governments have set up
state DM authorities under the direct control of the
respective chief minister. The chief secretary of the
state heads the state level executive committee,
which has the overall responsibility for relief

operations in the state. The DM commissioners
who are in charge of the relief and rehabilitation
measures in the wake of natural and other disasters
in their states function under the overall direction
and control of the state government. At the district
level, it is the collector/district magistrate/deputy
commissioner who exercises coordinating and
supervisory powers over all the departments at the
district level. For each natural disaster, the declared
nodal agencies are responsible for coordinating/
undertaking studies on the processes responsible
for hazards and for suggesting precautionary and
preventive measures, monitoring the disasters,
and developing early warning systems, etc.
1.9 National Disaster Management
Policy and Guidelines
The National Disaster Management Authority
has drafted the National Disaster Management
Policy. The present Landslide Disaster Management
Policy envisages a two-tiered system, with predisaster measures comprising preparedness,
prevention and mitigation, and post-disaster
measures comprising emergency response
(rescue and relief) and rehabilitation. Unlike
earthquakes and floods, landslides are localised
events, induced by certain causative factors that
are well understood. This hazard can be most
effectively controlled or reduced to a minimum
if initiatives and activities based on the most
modern technological and scientific approaches
are implemented through a well-coordinated
institutionalised mechanism.
i) The approach to the formulation of the
Guidelines comprises a participatory and
consultative process. The basic concepts
of this exercise include: An exhaustive
review, disaster-wise, of the actions/steps
taken so far by various agencies including
the central ministries and departments,
states, academic, scientific and technical
institutions, NGOs, etc.
ii) Identification of the residual agenda in
terms of operational, administrative,
financial and legal issues.
iii) Identification of the destination, in terms
of the goals and objectives to be attained
in the short- as well as the long-term, duly
prioritised as vital, essential and desirable,
with timelines and milestones.
iv) Drawing up a roadmap to the destination,
duly indicating the milestones to facilitate
easy monitoring.
v) Putting in place an institutional mechanism
that oversees the operationalisation of this
roadmap.
The NDMA will play a nodal role in initiating the
institutional measures for prevention, mitigation
and preparedness with a view to generating a
holistic, integrated and proactive approach to DM.
The institutional arrangements drawn up for the
implementation of DM plans assign an important
role to the NDMA and the nodal agency (GSI) for
coordinating and ensuring their implementation at
the national, state, district, and local levels.
The National Executive Committee (NEC),
statutorily mandated to assist the NDMA will be
responsible for preparing the national plan based
on the Policy and Guidelines. The NEC will also be
responsible for getting it approved by the NDMA
and then operationalising it.
The NDRF will play a pivotal role in specialised
response to a threatening disaster situation or
disaster. The general superintendence, direction
and control of this force will be vested in and
exercised by the NDMA.
At the state level, the SDMAs established by
the state governments to lay down policies and
plans for DM in the state will, inter-alia, approve
the state plan in accordance with the guidelines
laid down by the NDMA, and coordinate its
implementation.
The Context
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
20
Landslides are a significant natural hazard in the
country which not only threaten the environment,
human safety, infrastructure, and post-earthquake
relief operations, but also have a huge impact
on the national economy. This hazard deserves
much greater attention in terms of multi-hazard
mapping, research, scientific investigations, and
effective mitigation and management practices.
The Guidelines address all the varied aspects of
landslide mitigation and management, adopting a
holistic and integrated approach that maximises
the networking of voluntary agencies, affected
communities and other stakeholders.
1.10 Approach to the Guidelines
Consultations were initiated by the NDMA for
the development of Guidelines for the coordinated
and systematic management of landslide hazard.
The main objective of the Guidelines on Landslides
and Snow Avalanches is to generate awareness of
the various aspects of the landslide hazard in India
and to suggest suitable action to reduce both—
the risks and costs associated with this hazard.
Accordingly, the Guidelines envision an improved
administrative response, bringing together the
relevant scientific, engineering, construction,
planning, and policy capabilities of the Nation to
eliminate losses from landslides and other ground
failure hazards.
The long-term mission of these Guidelines is
to develop a strategy that encourages the use of
scientific information, maps, methodology, and
guidance for emergency management, land use
planning, development, and implementation of
public and private policy to reduce losses from
landslides and other ground failure hazards. It is
also important for the strategy to define the role of
local, state and national level bodies in combating
this hazard. In addition, the Guidelines describe the
required government policies at the national and
state levels, institutional arrangements, financial
arrangements, and planning for safe national
development.
While a good deal of work has already been
done to improve management of landslides and
snow avalanches, there are many areas which
require special focus and emphasis in the future.
Important among these are:
i) Hazard Zonation Mapping.
ii) Geological and Geotechnical Investigation.
iii) Landslide Risk Treatment.
iv) Monitoring and Forecasting of Landslides.
v) Regulation and Enforcement.
vi) Awareness and Preparedness.
vii) Capacity Development.
viii) Response.
ix) Research and Development.
x) Implementation of the Guidelines—
Preparation of Landslide Management
Plans.
In recognition of the need to pay special
attention to these relatively weaker areas, these
Guidelines have been structured into chapters
that deal with these disciplines in detail and make
recommendations with regard to specific action
points and timelines.

2.1 Introduction
Disaster mitigation efforts aim to assess the
status of the hazard and identify the scientific and
technological tools that can help in minimising
vulnerability and risk. These mitigation efforts
involve the identification of sites vulnerable to
hazards, and the intensity of hazards at specific
sites by preparing inventory databases, carrying
out hazard zonation mapping at different scales,
and selecting the sites that require detailed
investigation for estimating the hazard potential
and risk. This requires the utilisation of modern
techniques for mapping, such as the recent
developments in remote sensing, communication,
and instrumentation technologies.
2.2 Landslide Inventory
The main purpose behind the preparation
of a landslide inventory map and database is
the documentation of all the known landslide
incidences, including stabilised, dormant,
reactivated, and the most recent slides. The
documentation should include data about
the location, date of occurrence, rainfall, and
seismicity during the event, the dimension and
type of the slide, the volume of material dislodged,
the nature and extent of the damages caused/
likely to be caused by further sliding, the type
of triggering factor (earthquake, cloudburst,
anthropogenic interference, toe erosion by
streams or rivers, etc.), the tentative causative
factors leading to slope failure, and the limit of
the run-out distance. Colour photographs of the
landslide on the date of the investigation are an
additional asset to the record. Another important
parameter is the collection of historical records
for each landslide, which would give an idea
about the approximate return period of each
slide. All this information forms the foundation
for LHZ mapping, vulnerability assessment
and risk zonation mapping. It is not possible
to prepare a complete landslide inventory map
and database, since that would involve the field
mapping of each and every landslide incidence,
which is practically impossible. However, a few
countries like Australia, Italy, and New Zealand
have prepared landslide inventory maps based on
aerial photographs or satellite images.
A landslide inventory map not only shows the
time and date of occurrence, but the approaches,
ranging from digital stereo image interpretation to
automatic classification based either on spectral
or altitude differences, or a combination of both.
Multi-temporal images can be used to prepare
a landslide activity map. Stereo-images are not
only useful for the derivation of height information
but also for landslide inventory mapping, as they
provide three-dimensional visualisation.
Very high resolution imagery (QuickBird,
IKONOS, CARTOSAT-1 and 2) has become the best
option now for landslide mapping from satellite
images, and the number of operational sensors
with such characteristics is growing every year.
Other remote sensing approaches of landslide
inventory mapping include shaded relief images
produced by Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR),
Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry. LiDAR is
2 Hazard Zonation Mapping
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
22
an active sensor and the signal from this sensor
onboard aircraft has the capability of penetrating
the tree crown (most of the time) thus providing
data about subtle elevation variations of the bare
ground. LiDAR data have been used to prepare
landslide inventories in the forest areas of hilly
regions and to refine the landslide boundaries
prepared during field investigations. This data is
not only useful for mapping old landslides, but can
also improve field survey based investigations in
regions with subdued morphology. SAR images
are useful in identifying critical terrain elements
such as faults and slope characteristics. Also,
subtle movement due to landslides can be picked
up from interferograms generated from SAR
image pairs. Another advantage of SAR data over
optical sensor data is its all-weather monitoring
ability. So, a combination of SAR imagery with high
resolution optical multispectral imagery is useful
for monitoring debris hazards in mountainous
areas. However, problems such as foreshortening
and layover effects associated with SAR data in
mountainous areas have to be addressed carefully.
The preparation of a comprehensive and
user-friendly national landslide inventory database
will be taken up, paving the way for continuous
updating of the landslide map of India. This will
be achieved by a nation-wide networking of the
agencies engaged in the task and would be aided
by the latest geomatic tools, followed by field
checks.

2.3 Landslide Hazard Zonation
Mapping
The aim of LHZ mapping, which is needed for
risk assessment, is to determine the spatial and
temporal extent of a landslide hazard. In general
the LHZ map divides the landslide prone hilly
terrain into different zones according to the relative
degree of susceptibility to landslides. This requires
the identification of those areas that are, or could
be affected by landslides, and the assessment of
the probability of such landslides occurring within
a specific period of time. Commenting on the time
domain of landslide occurrence through zonation
mapping is a difficult task. Due to conceptual and
operational limitations, landslide hazard zonation
is conceptually stated as Landslide Susceptibility
Zonation (LSZ). The spatial prediction of landslides
is termed as landslide susceptibility, which is a
function of landslide and landslide related internal
factors (i.e., ground characteristics). The aim is
to identify places of landslide occurrence over a
region on the basis of a set of physical parameters.
LSZ can be formally defined as the division of the
land surface into near-homogeneous zones and
then ranking these according to the degree of
actual or potential hazard due to landslides. The
LSZ maps do not directly incorporate the time and
magnitude of landslide occurrences. Since LSZ
is conceptually accepted as LHZ, it is popularly
referred to as LHZ all over India.
A landslide risk zonation map integrates the
landslide hazard, vulnerability, and a quantification
of the elements at risk. It cannot be developed
unless an LHZ map is prepared. An important input
for the preparation of an LHZ map is a landslide
inventory database, which is not yet available in
India. Thus, a landslide hazard assessment broadly
involves the preparation of a landslide inventory,
a landslide hazard zonation map, followed by a
landslide risk zonation map.
An LHZ map requires the division of an area
into several zones, indicating the progressive levels
of the landslide hazard. The number of zones into
which a territory is divided is generally arbitrary.
Landslide hazard zonation entails the mapping of
all the possible landslides and landslide-induced
hazards in the required detail. The hazard maps
23
are designed to limit the information to the
users’ requirements, and to present it in a form
comprehensible to them. Indeed, the users’ maps
ought to be different from those prepared by, or
for specialists. Graded landslide hazard maps
are required by, among others, developmental
planners as tools for the efficient management
of land and its resources. Landslide hazard
maps are also essential for the assessment of
damage potential, and for the quantification of
risks. Scientific forecasting of a landslide for early
warning finds its first clue in the landslide hazard
map of the area.
It is necessary to understand the conditions
and processes of landslide control, and to
determine existing landslide hazards if future
landslide occurrence is to be estimated. A map
of existing landslides serves as the basic data
resource for understanding these conditions
and processes. Existing landslides and their
relationship with other key parameters—nature
of the slope forming material, slope inclination
and aspect, land cover, land use, climate, and
hydrology—form the basis for hazard assessment.
An all-inclusive approach to mapping
landslides, starting with the assessment of the
regional, geological, and geomorphological
settings, and then focusing on a detailed scale
is recommended. A comprehensive view of
the terrain is needed to identify all the possible
problems associated with slope conditions,
including existing and potential instability. It is
necessary to review the impact of geological
features located beyond the boundaries of the site
that could influence the status of the hazard in the
future. There may be vital evidence of instability
processes outside the area in consideration that
may not be evident on the site itself, but could
have a future impact on the site.
The available geological and geomorphological
maps form the basic inputs for LHZ mapping. It
is not possible to prepare all the thematic maps
covering a huge area solely through field work.
This problem can be solved with the help of aerial
photographs or satellite imagery, followed by
limited field checks.
The preparation of maps showing landslide
hazards includes:
i) The generation of thematic maps by
compiling and collating the observations
on geology, geomorphology, land use,
land cover, and the distribution of
landslide processes, including the use
of local records, interpretation of aerial
photographs, and high-resolution imagery.
ii) The collection of relevant information on
existing landslide hazards and the analysis
of potential landslide hazards, including
first time landslides.
iii) The identification of areas that could be
affected by landslide hazards in future.
iv) The transformation of process maps into
hazard maps identifying the potential
for spatial impact and the probability of
occurrence of hazards.
2.3.1 Selection of the Scale
Landslide related data and information have
to be mapped at a scale that is appropriate for
end-use purposes, to enable planners to make
decisions about future land use on or close to
landslides or landslide-affected areas. At present,
few local authorities have access to landslide
maps at an appropriate planning-level scale (i.e.,
approximately 1:10,000). Even where maps of
scale 1:50,000 are available, most of them are
not aware of their existence. While maps at the
scale of 1:50,000 or lower are appropriate for
regional studies, they are indicative only and do
not provide adequate detail and information for
planning purposes at the local level, such as the
municipal ward level. At present, very few areas in
the country have been mapped even at the scale
Hazard Zonation Mapping
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
24
of 1:50,000 or 1:25,000 that are preferred for
regional mapping. It is important that a landslide
hazard map be at a scale not markedly different
from the data maps used to produce it, or else
a misleading picture about the estimation of the
hazard might emerge.
Considering the importance of landslide
hazard and its mapping, the GoI, constituted
a task force on LHZ mapping in March 1999.
Keeping in view the availability of topographic
and geological maps in the country at present,
and recommendations of the task force, the
scales suggested for preparation of LHZ maps for
different purposes are given below.
Since it is not appropriate to carry out zonation
at a scale larger than 1:5,000, it is recommended
that zonation studies be carried out at a scale of
up to 1:5,000.
Landslide studies are being carried out at a
scale of up to 1:5,000 and at even larger scales
for detailed studies, depending on the size of the
landslide and other requirements. A nation-wide
consensus on selection of mapping scales will be
reached with a view to introducing rational uniform
procedures throughout the country.

the TAC and in collaboration with the NRSC; BIS;
DST; CBRI; CRRI; WIHG; IITs, universities, and
other academic institutions.]
2.3.2 Landslide Hazard Zonation Methodologies
The types of hazard analysis techniques in
practice generally include inventory and heuristic
methods. The taxonomy of the different types of
hazard zonation is given in the figure.
The LHZ maps produced by the various
organisations, institutions and individuals in
the country are either qualitative or semiquantitative. In either case, landslide inventory
has not been used as the basic input data. These
studies have conventionally been carried out
on manual interpretations of various thematic
maps and their super-imposition. During recent
years, the availability of a wide range of high
resolution remote sensing data in digital form
has been immensely helpful in the preparation,
interpretation, and analysis of data in the GIS
environment. As a result, it has become possible
to prepare different thematic maps corresponding
to different causative factors responsible for the
initiation of landslides, more accurately and within
a shorter period.
 2.3.3 Landslide Hazard Zonation Mapping at
the Macro Scale
Different institutions and individuals have in
the past carried out LHZ mapping at the macro
scale following their own methodologies. Keeping
in view the requirement of maintaining uniformity,
the task force appointed for this purpose
constituted by the GoI suggested that in order to
carry out LHZ mapping at the macro scale, it is
required that a uniform standardised methodology
be adopted throughout India. Keeping in view the
availability of methodologies and requirements of
the work, it is suggested that the BIS guidelines,

• At the Meso-Scale (1:5,000 to 1:10,000)
— municipalities, localities, etc.
• Mapping at a scale larger than the
meso-scale should be carried out for
site-specific studies and not for zonation.
25
although having some lacunae, may be adopted
with certain modifications for carrying out LHZ
mapping at the macro scale.
Approaches to landslide hazard mapping
being used by different agencies in India are at
variance with each other. The ongoing mapping
programmes should continue to make the best
use of the prevailing state-of-the-art technologies,
at the same time making a determined effort to
arrive at national level recommendations through
a process of workshops and rigorous peer review.
This will also hasten the revision of the related
BIS Code.

The BIS will critically review and revise its
guidelines on LHZ mapping, taking full advantage
of the experiences of the GSI and other agencies
in this field. This will be achieved within the next
two years. Subsequently, these will be revised
every five years. Till the existing BIS methodology
is revised and codified, the present guidelines
should be relied upon.
[Action: The BIS in collaboration with the GSI;
IITs, universities, and other academic institutions.]
The GSI, based on its experience of LHZ
mapping, has slightly modified the parameters
and weighting procedures included in the BIS
guidelines. It is carrying out LHZ mapping at the
macro scale using this modified methodology.

2.3.4 Landslide Hazard Zonation Mapping at
the Meso Scale
The preparation of LHZ maps at the meso
scale is yet to be practiced in India. There is
neither a code nor a standard methodology for
LHZ mapping at the meso scale. There are a few
instances when it was attempted by the GSI, in
the Nainital area, Mirik, and Gangtok, following the
BIS guidelines on macro scale mapping. A review
of these maps indicates that the overburden that
forms considerable slope forming material in the
case of the Himalayas has not been taken into
consideration. Therefore, the assessment made of
slope-stability status may not be realistic. Keeping
this in view and considering the requirement of
standardisation of methodology for LHZ mapping
at the meso scale, a methodology synthesising
both Slope Mass Rating (SMR) techniques and
BIS guidelines for LHZ mapping at the macro scale
has been suggested to the BIS and is under the
process of codification.
For LHZ mapping at the meso scale, two
additional factors have been added to the list for
macro scale LHZ mapping. The following geoenvironmental parameters/causative factors that
induce slope instability have been considered for
LHZ mapping at the meso scale:
It is recommended that the slope facet map,
slope morphometry map and relative relief map be
prepared from the Digital Elevation Module (DEM),
as these maps can be prepared more accurately
and within a shorter time period than with the
widely practiced manual method.
Remote-sensing data should be extensively
utilised in the preparation of LHZ maps. The
main contribution of EO data is to provide
morphological, land use, and geological details to
assist in determining the process and causes of
landslide failures. Satellite data essentially provides
information on geomorphology, lineament,
broad lithology, land use/land cover, drainage,
infrastructure, incidence of landslides based on
the terrain, the spatial extent of landslides, and
slope details. All this information can be derived at
the scale of 1:50,000 or 1:25,000, using different
visible IRS data, especially IRS-P6, LISS-IV, and
LISS-III. The CARTOSAT-1 data which has stereo
capability can be used to generate the DEM for the
area and this can be used to derive the slope facet,
morphology, and angle. The CARTOSAT-2 data with
high resolution (of more than one meter) can be
used for understanding the individual landslide
morphology. GIS techniques are increasingly used
for regional analysis and prediction. Geospatial
standards need to evolved for coding the thematic
data generated under the LHZ programme.

2. Structure 8. Slope erosion
3. Slope morphometry 9. Rainfall
4. Relative relief 10. Landslide inventory
5. Land cover 11. Seismicity
6. Land use 12. Geotechnical properties of the slope material
Table 2.1: Geo-Environmental Parameters for Slope Instability/LHZ
27
The NRSC has evolved standards for LHZ
mapping in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
and these need to be evaluated for adoption
into the national standards. There are various
methods for integrating the geospatial data in
the GIS environment. All these models need to be
evaluated before adopting an appropriate model
for the generation of LHZ maps. A customised
software in the GIS environment can be developed
by integrating the various thematic data.
Landslide susceptibility can also be
determined through the deterministic method,
which is followed in smaller areas at larger
scales (larger than 1:10,000). These methods are
process-based and give more detailed results,
expressing the hazard in terms of the factor of
safety to each mapping unit. The deterministic
method can quantitatively represent landslide
processes by considering the detailed physical
and dynamic in-situ parameters of the slope
forming material, and can easily be used to retrieve
temporal probability information by modelling
different groundwater scenarios caused by
different rainfall events (the triggering factor). The
deterministic methods depend highly on a large
number of detailed site-specific geotechnical and
groundwater parameters, otherwise their results
are oversimplified. That is why, for medium scale
(of 1:25,000 to 1:50,000) analysis in a large area,
the use of such deterministic methods may not
be feasible. Deterministic models are also difficult
to represent as 2D GIS spatial data products
because they consider depth wise data variability
for the calculation of the factor of safety. That is
why, for hazard assessment of bigger areas on
a medium scale, empirical methods based on
various statistical and mathematical techniques
are followed.
In medium scale landslide susceptibility
analysis, knowledge-driven/heuristic and datadriven empirical methods are prevalent. The
knowledge-driven methods are mostly qualitative
(direct), but semi-quantitative (indirect) methods
based on heuristics are also followed. The datadriven methods are mostly statistical (bivariate
and multivariate), while a few are mathematical
(artificial neural network).
The knowledge-driven/heuristic direct
approaches to spatial prediction of landslide
susceptibility involve detailed geomorphological
mapping using uniquely coded polygons, which
are evaluated one by one by an expert to assess
the type and degree of the hazard. The indirect
heuristic approach utilises data integration
techniques, including qualitative parameter
combination, in which the analyst assigns weight
values to a series of terrain parameters and to
each class within each parameter. The relative
importance of each terrain parameter as a
predisposing determining factor of slope instability
is quantitatively determined by a pair-wise
comparison using the so-called Analytical Hierarchy
Process (AHP). In direct heuristic methods, the
use of detailed geomorphological factor maps
in general has raised the overall accuracy of the
susceptibility maps, though the accuracy of such
direct qualitative models depends largely on the
experience of the expert using the method. In
the indirect heuristic methods, however, similar
weight values are considered for all locations
within the same factor. The addition of such unique
weight values tends to ‘flatten out’ the results of
indirect methods. Thus, the main limitations of the
knowledge-driven methods are the subjectivity
involved both in the direct mapping as well as in
the assignment of weights in the indirect method,
and the general non-availability of any quantitative
technique of model validation.
Among the quantitative methods, the
application of bivariate statistics (e.g., the weight
of evidence method) in landslide spatial prediction
is common and it needs to be weighed in light of
Hazard Zonation Mapping
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
28
the following limitations because of misapplication
by many researchers, which include:
i) Generalisation by assuming that landslides
happen under the same combination of
factors throughout the study area, ignoring
the fact that each landslide type has its
own set of causal factors, and should be
analysed individually.
ii) Lack of suitable expert opinion on different
landslide types and processes and on
landslides of different periods, which may be
inevitable if these methods are solely applied
by GIS experts, and not by earth scientists.
Bivariate or multivariate methods may be
found to be statistically suitable to predict future
landslides at medium scales (of 1:25,000 to
1:50,000), but logical explanations of the results
or outputs and exact knowledge about the
dependencies of causal parameters with the target
are sometimes absent in these types of methods.
Since these methods are mostly based on various
statistical data treatments focused mainly on the
objective elimination or reduction of errors and
uncertainty in prediction, the aspects of data
quality, reasoned selection of input parameters
and inherent fuzziness of some data on geofactors,
etc., are frequently overlooked. Multivariate
methods, in spite of limitations and pitfalls in
application, are used nowadays as among the
most feasible quantitative tools for assessing
different levels of landslide susceptibility. For
example, when a set of independent variables
include both good and bad predictors (the latter
having no clear physical relationship with mass
movement processes), a step-wise regression
technique in multivariate statistics is followed with
an aim to eliminate statistically non-significant
factors, but sometimes the output of these
analyses may generate unreliable and meaningless
results. In a similar way, the Artificial Neural
Network (ANN)—a mathematical technique—is
also used for the spatial prediction of landslide
hazards. The ANN method is not sensitive to any
statistical distribution of data, and can integrate
both continuous as well as categorical data sets.
The ANN methods are adaptive and generic in
nature. They are construed to handle imperfect or
incomplete data sets and can capture non-linear
and complex interactions among the variables of
a system. Since ANN is almost independent of
the quality of the input variable; there are chances
of getting an unexpected quality in results which
can sometimes be highly abstract and misleading.
Like other multivariate techniques, in the ANN
method also, the internal processes which train
the input data set and minimise statistical errors
and uncertainties are difficult to follow.
The final landslide map generated should
be user friendly and simple enough to be easily
comprehended by planners and other users.
The most important inputs required for carrying
LHZ mapping at both the macro and meso scale
are topographical and geological maps, remote
sensing products, and seismological data in the
case of seismogenic landslides. Repositories of
these are the Survey of India (SoI), GSI, NRSC,
and India Meteorological Department (IMD). These
agencies will be made an integral part of any effort
in this direction so that the work does not suffer for
want of these vital inputs, and additional demands
can also be serviced.
The IMD and CWC will have to increase
the network density of rain gauge stations
(with particular reference to major landslide
susceptibility locations) and seismic observatories
in hilly regions. The SoI should also take up the
task of generating topographic/contour maps at
the scale of 1:5,000 or 1:10,000 for the landslide
affected hilly regions of India. A mechanism will
be put in place so that the seismic and rainfall data
are communicated to the national landslide hazard
database centre on a real-time basis.

2.3.5 Seismic Landslide Hazard Zonation (SLHZ)
The principal triggers for landslides are
rainfall, earthquake and anthropogenic activities.
Since landslides in most areas of the country
can co-occur with other hazardous events like
earthquakes, high rainfall or cloudbursts, these
areas can suffer from more than one hazard at
a time. Therefore it is necessary that the risk
emanating from all these hazards be considered
while assessing the total risk. This makes it
necessary to integrate the landslide hazard into
the multi-hazard concept. It is observed that the
Vulnerability Atlas of India prepared by BMTPC
does not include the landslide hazard while
assessing the vulnerability of various locales. It
is therefore necessary that the landslide hazard
is incorporated into such attempts to get the true
status of the vulnerability of the area.
Landslides triggered or induced by earthquakes
are known as co-seismic landslides. Earthquaketriggered landslides occur when existing landslides
are activated by an earthquake, or fresh, first
time landslides generated by it. Earthquakeinduced first time landslides are few, compared
to earthquake-triggered existing landslides. In a
great majority of cases, landslides take place with
the earthquake shock, but some may also occur
hours or days after the shock. It is observed that
the extent of the area within which landsliding
is generated tends to increase with the shock
magnitude. Seismically generated landslides occur
suddenly in a more widespread area
The most abundant types of earthquakeinduced landslides are rock falls and slides of slope
forming material resting on steep slopes. However,
while almost every other type of landslide can
occur due to an earthquake, landslides resulting
from liquefaction are caused by seismic events
only. Other types of mass movements generally
related to seismic activity are:
i) Rock avalanches that originate on oversteepened slopes with weak rocks.
ii) Mud flows and rapidly moving wet earth
flows that can be initiated by earthquake
tremors.
Comprehensive research, development and
field-oriented studies on problematic slopes with
the help of instruments should be undertaken to
improve our understanding of earthquake induced
landslides. Multi-hazard and seismic microzonation programmes would be enriched by an
added focus on the hitherto neglected subject of
earthquake-induced landslides in hilly areas and
their effects on slope instability.

2.3.6 Prioritisation of Areas for LHZ Mapping
The areas susceptible to landslides are the
Himalayan belt, the Naga-Arakan range, the
southern margin of the Shillong Plateau, parts
of the Western and Eastern Ghats, the Nilgiris,
and the Ranchi Plateau, aggregating 0.49 million
sq. km. These will have to be mapped for the
preparation of LHZ maps at scales of 1:25,000
or 1:50,000.
It is further estimated that the area around
150 towns, 1,500 villages and 6,000 km of road
corridors would need to be covered at the macro
and meso scale. The work related to LHZ mapping
at both the macro and meso scale will be taken
up in two phases. In the first phase the areas
proposed to be covered are as follows:
Hazard Zonation Mapping
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
30
At the Macro Scale
i) Keeping in view the immediate civilian and
strategic demands, areas along specified
road corridors in the Himalayas and the
North-Eastern Region (NER).
ii) Critical transportation corridors in the
Western Ghats and Nilgiris.
iii) Critical areas with inhabited towns, villages,
pilgrim centres, and pilgrim routes in the
Western and Eastern Himalayas.
The identified areas for macro scale LHZ
mapping are proposed to be completed during
the first phase by 2013. The mapping will be
done by various institutions, of which a major
portion will be done by the GSI. It is proposed
that in the second phase, the macro scale LHZ
mapping may be taken up district- or basin-wise
in the Lesser and Outer Himalayas, the NER
and the Nilgiris in the areas not covered in the
first phase. Subsequently, the LHZ mapping
can be extended to difficult areas in the Higher
Himalayas and the interior areas of the NER.
Depending upon the availability of resources,
the second phase will extend up to 2020 or
beyond. The national priorities will be reviewed
and mapping methodologies improved as the
work progresses.
[Action: SDMAs/state governments in collaboration
with the TAC; MoM-GSI; NRSC; DST; BRO; WIHG;
Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs); CRRI.]
At the Meso Scale
•	 Areas around urban agglomerations,
including those having high growth
potential in the Himalayas and the NER.
•	 Critical transportation corridors in the
Western Ghats.
•	 Critical areas in the Nilgiris having high
growth/development potential.
•	 Areas with a high potential for the siting
of hydroelectric power structures in the
Himalayas and the NER.
Areas within the above categories deserve
more or less the same priority. Within these
categories are around 100 towns/pilgrim centres
and 1,000 villages in the Western Himalayas along
with about 50 towns/pilgrims centres and 50
villages in the NER. The road and rail network in
the Himalayas, the NER, the Western Ghats and
Nilgiris may add up to 10,000 km. The areas in
the Western Himalayas and the NER having high
hydroelectric power potential could add up to a
total catchment area of around 20,000 sq. km.
However, this component can be taken up in the
first phase based on demand from hydropower
developers or state governments.
The locations requiring studies at the meso
scale shall be identified in consultation with state
governments and other agencies, prioritised and
taken up for LHZ mapping in a phased manner,
depending upon the availability of resources. In
the second phase of LHZ mapping at the meso
scale, the areas not covered during the first phase
will be taken up. The work carried out in this phase
will extend up to 2020 or beyond, depending on
the resources available.

2.4 Landslide Risk Assessment
A natural hazard is the probability of a
damaging event occurring with a specified
magnitude within a defined time period and area.
Risk is a measure of the probability and severity
of the damaging event.
Landslide risk can be defined as the potential
for adverse consequences, loss, harm or detriment
31
to human populations and other things of value
to humans, due to landslide occurrence. Hence,
landslide risk is a combination of the probability
of landslide occurrence and its consequences.
The management of this risk involves the
complete process of risk assessment and risk
control. Risk assessment—the process of risk
analysis and risk evaluation—is the first and most
important step of risk management. Conducting
risk assessment can provide information on the
location of the hazard, the value of land and
property on this location, and an analysis of
the risk to life, property, and the environment
that may result from natural hazard events. The
complete risk management process comprises
three components:
i) Risk analysis.
ii) Risk evaluation.
iii) Risk treatment.
Risk Analysis: Risk analysis is the use of available
information to estimate the risk to individuals or
populations, property, or the environment from
the hazard. The effects of landslides may not be
limited to damage of property and injury/loss of life.
Other consequences may include public outrage,
political effects, loss of business confidence,
social upheaval, and consequential costs, such
as litigation. It is important to define the site, the
geographical limits of the processes that affect the
site, the scope of analysis, the extent and nature
of the investigations that will be carried out, the
types of analysis that will be conducted, and the
basis for assessment of acceptable and tolerable
risks. Subsequent to hazard identification, risk
estimation must be carried out.
Risk estimation may be carried out
quantitatively, semi-quantitatively or qualitatively.
Wherever possible, the risk estimate should be
based on a quantitative analysis, even though
the results may be summarised in qualitative
terminology.
A complete risk analysis involves the
consideration of all landslide hazards for the
site (e.g., large, deep seated landsliding, smaller
landslides, boulder falls, debris flows) and all the
elements at risk. For total risk the risk for each
hazard and for each element is summed up. Most of
the approaches applied for carrying out Landslide
Risk Analysis (LRA) have inherent limitations, but
risk analysis has the benefit of encouraging a
systematic approach to a problem and promoting
greater understanding of the consequences. Risk
analysis, assessment, and evaluation can be done
through a multidisciplinary approach. In this effort,
geological and geotechnical investigations play an
important role.
LRA can be done at different stages in
the decision-making process, starting from
developmental planning on a regional scale
to the evaluation of a particular site on a local
scale. Landslide risk assessment on the regional
scale leads to the demarcation of areas with
different levels of threat to elements at risk. This
information can be used to establish land use
plans, developmental activities and patterns of
building regulations. LRA on the regional scale
depends on two factors:
i) The spatial probability of landslide
occurrence in a region.
ii) The vulnerability of the resources at risk.
The spatial probability of landslide occurrence
depends on the causative factors. Hence, LHZ
maps may be used to define the landslide potential
in a region.
Vulnerability may be defined as the level
of potential damage, or the degree of loss of
resources at risk when subjected to a landslide
occurrence of a given intensity. Vulnerability
assessment involves the understanding of the
interaction between a given landslide and the
affected resources. Generally, vulnerability to a
particular landslide may depend on the volume
Hazard Zonation Mapping
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
32
and velocity of sliding, the distance travelled
by the sliding material, the resources at risk,
and their nature and proximity to the landslide.
The assessment of vulnerability is somewhat
subjective and may largely be based on the
historical data of the region. However, in the case
of regional scale vulnerability assessment, the
resources at risk and their nature and proximity
to landslide hazard zones will be considered. The
appropriate vulnerability factor may be assessed
systematically based on the opinion of experts,
and can be expressed on a scale of 0 to 1.
In the present context of regional risk analysis
at regional/macro/meso scales, LRA can be
considered as a function of Landslide Potential
(LP) and Resource Damage Potential (RDP). The
LP and RDP can be characterised by the LHZ map
and the resource map (i.e., land use and land cover
map) of the area, respectively. The LRA map can
be obtained by integrating landslide susceptibility
and resource damage potential at the spatial level.
This map can be categorised into different risk
zones. Risk zonation maps, therefore, essentially
include the LHZ map, vulnerability map and
elements at risk map. The LHZ map is generated
by the integration of thematic maps and landslide
incidence maps (Figure 2.1).
For site specific LRA, run-out effect analysis
due to specific landslides based on the travel
distance analysis method can be implemented.
In risk analysis, the role of remote sensing
is important to provide the necessary inputs
for identifying the elements at risk. The large
coverage of satellite data with its temporal
capability is useful for mapping land use/land
cover, infrastructure and settlements, which are
vital inputs for LRAs.
Risk Evaluation: Risk evaluation is the final
step in the risk assessment process. The main
objectives of risk evaluation are usually to decide
whether to accept or to treat the risks, and to
identify priorities. Risk evaluation involves making
judgments about the significance and acceptability
of the estimated risk. Evaluation may involve a
comparison of the risks assessed with other risks
or with risk acceptance criteria related to financial
aspects, loss of life or other values. Risk evaluation
may include the consideration of issues such as
environmental effects, public reaction, politics,
business or public confidence. While evaluating
risk, it is important to distinguish between
acceptable risk that society is prepared to accept
without regard to its management, and tolerable
risk that it is willing to live with in the confidence
that it is being properly controlled and monitored.
This applies to loss of property and life.
2.4.1 Landslide Risk Zonation
Landslide risk zonation has so far not been
attempted in India. Most of the organisations and
institutes in our country carry out LHZ mapping
which is significantly different from landslide
risk zonation. The four data inputs required
for risk zonation are environmental factors,
triggering factors, historic landslide occurrence
and elements at risk.
The historic information on landslide
occurrence is by far the most important input as
it gives insight into the frequency of the events,
the types of landslides, and the volume and extent
of damage. Landslide inventory maps, derived
from historical archives, field data collection,
interviews of the affected community and image
interpretation are essential. As all this data is
not readily available, quantitative landslide risk
assessment becomes very difficult.
Information on triggering factors consists of
earthquake and rainfall records, which have to be
converted into magnitude-frequency relations of
those aspects that actually trigger landslides, e.g.,
earthquake acceleration or groundwater depth.
33
These parameters are very site specific and can
only be modelled properly using deterministic
models, which require considerable input on the
geotechnical characterisation of the terrain (soil
depth, cohesion, friction angle, and permeability).
Temporal probability is determined either by
correlating the data on landslide occurrence with
that of triggering factors, or through dynamic
modelling. On the other hand, the spatial
probability can be obtained either through dynamic
modelling or by analysing the relation between
the locations of past landslide events with a set
of environmental factors.
Hazard Zonation Mapping
Figure 2.2: Landslide Management Maps and Procedures
Investment decisions are taken depending
upon the level of risk and the corresponding risk
reduction initiatives (Figure 2.3). Considering the
importance of landslide risk zonation mapping, a
proposal has been recently drawn up by the BIS
to frame guidelines for landslide risk zonation
mapping, and the GSI along with some members
of the sectional committee on the Hill Development
Council of the BIS have been requested to prepare
the draft guidelines.

3 Geological and Geotechnical
Investigations
3.1 Introduction
A landslide is one natural disaster that can
be predicted and managed if its development is
monitored and a detailed analysis carried out to
determine the factors responsible for its activation.
For understanding landslides, we need to know
the plausible slide boundaries, mode of failure,
shear strength variation along slide boundaries
and spatial variation of pore water suction or pore
water pressure, possible causes of slope instability,
and the factors responsible for triggering the
movement. This can be achieved through detailed
scientific investigation of a slope or landslide in
a multi-disciplinary domain, where engineering
geologists and geotechnical engineers play an
important and highly inter-related role. Sound
geotechnical investigation followed by sound data
analysis is fundamental to the entire range of tasks
from slope characterisation to slope engineering.
Good slope geotechnology is not possible without
essential hydro-geological, seismo-tectonic and
anthropogenic inputs for slope analysis. Slope
geotechnology therefore has an expansive and
specialised scope. A landslide investigation team
will naturally be regarded as incomplete without
an experienced engineering geologist and an
equally experienced geotechnical engineer. The
methodology to be followed for carrying out
detailed analysis depends on the geological,
geomorphological and climatic conditions at
the site affected by the landslide. As the geoenvironmental conditions, causative factors and
triggering agents responsible for inducing slope
instability vary from site to site, it is not possible
to lay firm guidelines for landslide investigation
and treatment. However, broad guidelines can be
formulated that define the minimum investigation
to be carried out at a site to obtain data required
for a fairly realistic analysis.
3.2 Geological Investigations
Landslide investigation and mitigation requires
mapping of landslide hazards and creation of a
knowledge database with the fullest appreciation
of the scale and degree of reliability of information
gathered. For estimating the destructive potential
of a landslide, one needs to know its expanse/
spatial extent and also the time scale of landslide
activity, mechanism, run-out distance, elements
at risk en route, and its recurrence history. For
landslide prediction one needs to find out when
and where it will occur, and how far and how fast
it will move. For the design of control measures
for landslide management, one needs to know
the landslide type (its classification), the different
possible modes of failure, the location of the
landslide boundaries, the operating shear strength
characteristics of the boundary shears, and how
the pore pressures will vary on the landslide
boundaries with time.
The term geological investigation covers
both surface and sub-surface explorations to
be carried out to determine the extent of the
landslide in all dimensions, nature and disposition
of geological formations, structures in the area,
physical and geotechnical characteristics of the
material involved in the landslide process, factors
responsible for activating the landslide, and the
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
36
severity of the hazard. The extent of geological
investigation should be planned keeping the above
factors in view.
The geological investigation of landslides
can be divided into different stages and these
investigations proceed sequentially from one
stage to the other with some overlap. The different
stages of investigation are:
i) Preliminary geological investigation.
ii) Detailed geological investigation.
iii) Geotechnical investigation.
iv) Treatment implementation stage investigation.
v) Post-implementation stage investigation/
monitoring.
3.2.1 Preliminary Stage Geological
Investigation
The preliminary stage investigation involves
collection of available information, desk study as
well as initial reconnoitering traverses in the field
to collect regional as well as local information
and data.
Extensive use of remote sensing products
including high resolution CARTOSAT-1 and 2
should be made to demarcate the area likely to
be affected by further landsliding, understand the
dynamic behaviour of the landslide, delineate the
modified slope conditions by preparing DEM, etc.
Field Surveys and Investigations: The first
task to be taken up in the field after finishing
the desk work is to verify and validate the data
collected and to plan the further course of work.
Preliminary field surveys in the landslide area
should be carried out with a view to assess:
i) The dimensions, geometry and nature of
the landslide and the status of landsliding
activity.
ii) The condition of the ground beyond the
boundaries of the landslide.
iii) The orientation, spacing and openings of
all the cracks.
iv) Disposition of accumulation zones,
depletion and scarp faces, and distribution
pattern of different size fractions in debris.
v) Disposition, attitude of bedding,
foliation and all other planar structures,
the lithological variation of rocks, state
of weathering, joint/fracture spacing,
openness, roughness, continuity, joint/
fracture wall alteration, etc.
vi) The locations of seepage, springs, natural
drainage courses, and slushy ground.
vii) The movement of different parts of the
landslide during the investigation period.
viii) The location of human habitation,
communication corridors and other civil
engineering structures.
ix) The weathering profile, nature of the slope
forming material, study of overburden and
rock contact, nature of drainage, springs,
scarps, etc.
x) The demarcation of the buffer zone based
on the trajectory of the falling rock blocks
between the toe of the hill and the human
settlements or other structures to avoid
any risk factor during landslide treatment.
3.2.2 Detailed Geological Investigations
The detailed geological investigations, both
surface as well as sub-surface, which are required
to be carried out at this stage shall be in addition
to the studies already carried out. The extent of the
area to be covered by geological mapping and the
extent of the sub-surface geological investigations
required are to be guided by the geological
complexity of the site. Detailed investigations at
37
this stage should be planned and executed in close
cooperation and interaction between engineering
geologists and geotechnical engineers.
After the completion of surface geological
mapping, the behaviour of surface material and
other in-depth features need to be explored. The
sub-surface explorations required for this should
aim to establish:
i) The depth to bedrock or thickness of the
overburden, and weathering limit. The
lithological characters of various rock units
and their significance. The limits of slump
joints and glide cracks, if any.
ii) The nature, spacing, and continuity of
prominent joints, slip surface, minor and
major shear zones, etc.
iii) The depth of the groundwater table.
iv) The permeability of strata.
v) If possible, the depth and disposition of
the plane along which the failure has taken
place.
The above parameters can be determined by
employing non-destructive geophysical techniques
that are easily available. Geophysical exploration
should be done, especially in areas covered with
debris or river-borne material/terrace deposits.
Geophysical surveys, including resistivity surveys
and seismic refraction surveys, have been found
to be helpful in the determination of the above
parameters. With developments in electronic and
software technologies, the results are becoming
more accurate and dependable.
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) can initially
be employed in such surveys for evaluating the
depth and nature of bedrock and ground water
conditions as well. GPR surveys provide quick
results. Other geophysical surveys like seismic
(reflection) and resistivity surveys can follow the
initial GPR Surveys.
The preliminary and detailed geological
investigation of landslides constitutes the
foundation on which sound geotechnical
investigation must be built. Detailed guidelines will
be developed for ensuring systematic geological
investigation and mapping.

3.3 Geotechnical Investigations
The geotechnical investigation of a landslide
includes mapping of the problematic slope at the
appropriate scale, scientific understanding of its
kinetics, elucidation of the landslide boundaries,
determination of representative shear strength
parameters and pore pressure variations on the
landslide boundaries, and finally, the evaluation
of the safety factor. It is important to understand
the distinction between first time and reactivated
slides. The boundaries of first time slides are
not known in advance while reactivated slides
generally have predefined boundaries which are
sometimes modified due to further sliding.
Geotechnical investigations for mass
movements like rapid motion landslides, multi-tier
landslides, rock falls, debris flows and avalanches
may throw up many other investigational
requirements. There could also be cases of
landslides changing their character. For instance,
in its wetter manifestation, a landslide may take on
the character of a flow and acquire rapid motion.
In such cases the laws of fluid dynamics may take
over from the laws of classical soil mechanics.
A good geotechnical slope investigation is
usually driven by the leads thrown up by a large
scale geomorphological map of the area. It should
always begin with a careful study of the field
evidence by a trained landslide investigator. For
Geological and Geotechnical Investigations
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
38
instance, the study of the landslide boundaries,
exposed lithologies, discontinuities, shear zones,
water springs, aquifers, slope subsidence, heave,
cracks, behaviour of buildings, etc., can provide a
sense of direction to the nature and quantum of the
ensuing detailed sub-slope geotechnical investigation.
Guidelines will be developed to usher in the
culture of sound geotechnical investigation suited
to different geological settings and anthropogenic
situations. Systematic scientific geotechnical
investigation will become an essential component
of any important landslide management
initiative. The training of professionals, writing
of field manuals, and introduction of appropriate
tools and techniques for investigation will be
accorded priority. The guidelines will emphasise
the importance of fashioning geotechnical
investigations on hard field evidence and the
previous history of the slope. The importance of
arriving at critical slope profiles, elucidation of the
possible modes of failure, and purpose oriented
field and laboratory testing and instrumentation
for the validation of design assumptions will
be highlighted to improve the health of current
engineering practices. Engineering geologists
and geotechnical engineers will be jointly trained
to raise the standards of investigation and data
analysis. All major landslide remediation works
will be linked intimately with the findings of
geotechnical reports.
[Action: The BIS in collaboration with the NIDM;
DST; CDMM; MoM-GSI; CBRI; CRRI; WIHG; CoA;
IITs, universities and other academic institutions.]
No matter how thorough the geotechnical
investigation, uncertainties involved would
always call for making design assumptions based
on engineering judgment. Every geotechnical
report must clearly state the assumptions made
and the basis thereof. It would therefore be a
big mistake to prescribe a rigid programme of
soil investigation at the outset. The best soil
investigation programmes are those which are
modulated as the investigations advance and new
information emerges.
A geotechnical investigation often tends to
become expensive and even wasteful if it does not
relate closely to the slope information required and
specific questions that need answers. For instance,
in many cases an extensive programme of drilling
is prescribed to locate the basal boundary shear
of a landslide even without a site visit. One must
remember that even with extensive drilling, the
basal boundary of a landslide may defy attention
in the core logs. Considerable savings of both
time and money could be achieved if one were
to succeed in locating traces of basal boundary
shears in, for example, road side cutting.
The selection of equipment for slope
investigation, drilling and in situ testing, and
decisions on the scale, scope, and type of
undisturbed sampling and laboratory testing are
highly specialised matters. The present tendency
of making divergent, uninformed choices without
adequate scientific reasoning must end. There is a
need to develop guidelines on this, especially for
the training of geotechnical engineers engaged
in landslide projects as well as for the benefit
of those responsible for building up institutional
capacities.
The private sector can play a major role
in improving the national capacity for quality
geotechnical investigations and will be encouraged
to do so through professional bodies like the Indian
Geotechnical Society (IGS).
[Action: The DST in collaboration with the TAC;
IGS; engineering project authorities.]
The deterministic analysis of a slope can be
either two dimensional or three dimensional. A
two dimensional analysis underestimates the
factor of safety and is therefore done either where
39
satellite imagery and ground surveys, should be
logical and strong. Landslide investigation without
remote sensing is often blind. By the same logic,
landslide investigation without ground studies and
validation is lame.
The geotechnical investigation of landslides,
which in their wetter manifestations take on the
character of a flow, calls for a different kind of
investigation. In most such cases the laws of
fluid mechanics tend to take over from the laws
of soil mechanics. The major difference lies in the
short-lived nature of slip surfaces and the kinetics
of mass movement. The classical methods of
slope analysis or back analysis may no longer
remain valid.
Landslides in meta-stable deposits of granular
(sandy) nature, especially in high rainfall areas,
tend to liquefy due to an earthquake shock or
external vibration, generating flow slides. Similarly,
earthquake-induced landslides could be coseismic or post-seismic.
Geotechnical investigations for such a set of
problems fall in a specialised domain and must be
critically examined by investigators.

the TAC and in collaboration with the IMD; DST;

3.3.1 Culture of the Observational Method of
Design and Construction
The phenomena involved in slope engineering
are indeed complex and the observational
method is the best approach to deal with issues
of slope stability. Recourse to the observational
method provides a powerful defence against the
uncertainties and complexities of slope processes
as they unfold, as the observations pro-actively aid
the modification of the design as one proceeds.
Geological and Geotechnical Investigations
side resistance to landsliding is negligible or
uncertainties are large and quick, and conservative
designs are required for further planning. For
important projects where high quality investigation
is mandatory, a three dimensional analysis should
be done for ensuring economy in design. Since
there are uncertainties involved at various steps
of investigation and design, and it is not always
possible to justify single value inputs, the need for
and merit of a probabilistic analysis of the slope
must also be considered.
The deterministic analysis could either be in
terms of effective stress or in terms of total stress.
There is a need to develop guidelines for
scientific analysis of slopes and landslides
in terms of total and effective stress, as the
ground situation demands. Every report will
specifically point out the assumptions made and
the limitations of the data used in slope analysis
and design. The guidelines must clearly focus
on hitherto neglected but vital aspects such as
techniques of undisturbed sampling of shear
zones and boundary shears and the evaluation of
shear strength parameters using an appropriate
stress path.
[Action: The BIS in collaboration with the CDMM;
Council of Architecture (CoA); IITs, universities and
other academic institutions.]
Since most landslides are the result of poor
slope and sub-slope drainage, detailed hydrological
studies of the catchments associated with landslides
are essential. In areas of complex landforms with
water streams, springs and ill-defined overland flow,
radioisotope studies are often useful in mapping
subterranean water flow while investigating the
causative factors of a landslide.
For the ultimate objective of an investigation
to be achieved, the coupling between the study
of landslides through remote sensing such as
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
40
In this context the current practices in the
country need to be reformed as they do not even
insist on adequate and timely slope investigation
before the design gets finalised and slopes get
treated. Very often, the initial neglect of a slope
failure or landslide eventually grows into a major
problem calling for urgent attention. The problem
becomes too dangerous to be left untreated and
tight project schedules usually do not allow the
time normally required for systematic investigation
and slope treatment. Professionals usually
succumb to such pressures and evolve a scheme
of slope treatment without even basic information
on the landslide boundaries, various possible
modes of failure, causative factors, operating
shear strength parameters and spatial piezometric
variations. This amounts to treatment of slopes
without diagnosing the causes responsible for
inducing instability.
There is an urgent need to sensitise
professionals on how to handle slope failures
and their remediation, as well as landslide
emergencies and uncertainties by making efficient
use of the observational method and the power
of engineering judgment. The culture of the
observational method of design and construction
will be promoted with training on the development
of contingency plans.
[Action: The NIDM in collaboration with the
CDMM; CoA; IITs, universities and other academic
institutions.]
The present tendering process normally does
not allow designs to be altered as uncertainties
melt and assumptions change with more field
data becoming available. Unless financial
managers allow the flexibility necessary to revise
geotechnical investigation and design as the work
proceeds, the culture of the observational method
of design and construction will continue to elude
us. No professional will be ready to speak about
the error of engineering judgment and its ensuing
negative impact on the health of the project unless
the system appreciates these limitations and
allows for more freedom.
Despite the best geotechnical investigation,
several questions always remain unanswered. It
should, therefore, be normal practice to check the
validity of design assumptions and monitor slope
behaviour concurrently with the investigation and
implementation of slope stability treatment. Such
an approach will help in boosting confidence in
the designs and dealing with uncertainties, and
getting a premonition of any impending slope
failure.
Uncertainties on the account of inherently
aleatory, epistemic uncertainties due to
instrumentation and human limitations during
landslide investigations are also understandable
and can be minimised through the use of
appropriate technologies. What is unacceptable
however is the remediation and management
of landslides, ignoring the need for scientific
investigation and reliable diagnosis.
3.4 Earthquake-Induced Landslides
A clear distinction is essential between
earthquake-triggered and earthquake-induced
landslides. Earthquake events are usually
known to serve as a trigger for pre-existing but
dormant landslides, causing earthquake-triggered
landslides. Strong tremors, however, also hold
the potential for inducing new slides, especially
by rupture along unfavourable discontinuities
and shear zones. Such slides are designated as
earthquake-induced landslides. It should also
be recognised that the commonest class of the
best-understood problems are flow slides due to
liquefaction. Other possibilities are:
i) Reactivation of old, dormant or previously
inactive landslides.
ii) Acceleration of known landslides.
41
iii) Triggering of rock falls.
iv) Development of fresh, first time landslides.
v) Onset of slumping and breaking up of the
ground.
To understand the entire process, prior
understanding is required of:
i) Topographic and hydrological controls.
ii) Geological and geotechnical controls.
iii) Seismological controls.
iv) Anthropogenic controls.
Ground surface acceleration alone is a poor
measure of the effect of shaking on slope stability.
The intensity is even more so. Indicators such as
ground velocity, experience of past earthquake
events, and the duration of shaking are considered
to be better indicators of landslide susceptibility
under seismic conditions. The critical acceleration
of a slope is also an important factor in gauging
the seismic safety of a slope. The factor of safety
during an earthquake may drop below one (limit
equilibrium state) for a short duration of time, but
the effect of failure on the slope may perhaps be
negligible, and needs to be determined.
The observation that catastrophic landslide
events are post-seismic rather than co-seismic
phenomena needs to be investigated. While
earthquakes provide the trigger, the development
of a landslide is seldom sudden, and it usually
occurs after the earthquake and its after-shocks.
3.5 Pilot Project for the Investigation
of Major Landslides
A few major landslides will be identified
for creating pace setter practical examples
of systematic and scientific geotechnical
investigations which will include detailed geological
and geotechnical mapping at the scale of 1:500 or
1:1,000. The identification and investigation will
be done by assigning tasks to organisations or
institutions identified as having multi-disciplinary
expertise and experience. These organisations will
not only aid in the development of a systematic
method but also assist in the development of
standard codes, and planning for capacity building
for geological and geotechnical investigations.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the MoM-GSI;
BRO; CBRI; CRRI; DST; CDMM; WIHG; BIS; IITs,
universities and other academic institutions.]
On a long-term basis, a comprehensive
programme to investigate disruptive landslides
is needed. This will involve the identification of
all the devastating landslides in the country and
the initiation of site specific studies for some of
them (at least 10 in number) in a standardised
format. This will give impetus to complete sitespecific studies of all high-risk landslides and the
formulation of realistic treatment plans.

4 Landslide Risk Treatment
4.1 Introduction
Risk treatment is the ultimate aim of risk
management which helps in mitigating the
effects of a natural hazard. Once the risk has been
analysed, the strategy is to identify the options
and methods for treating the risk. Some typical
options would be to accept the risk, avoid the risk,
reduce the likelihood, reduce the consequences,
install monitoring and warning systems, transfer
the risk, or if there is sufficient uncertainty from
the available data, postpone the decision. The
relative costs and benefits of the available options
need to be considered so that the most costeffective solutions, consistent with the overall
needs, can be identified. A combination of options
or alternatives may be appropriate, particularly
where a relatively large reduction in risk can be
achieved at a relatively small cost. A treatment
plan for each option may be used to delineate
how the option will be implemented. The plan
also needs to identify the responsibilities of each
stakeholder during and after implementation,
the extent of work required, cost estimates,
the implementation programme, performance
evaluation of the measures, and the expected
outcome. Monitoring of the treatment plan and
the risks involved is needed to ensure that the plan
is effective and changes in circumstances do not
alter the risks. It is essential to reconsider all the
stages of analysis, assessment, and prioritisation
as the treatment plan evolves and is implemented.
The results of monitoring may enable feedback for
reassessment of the risks.
Landslide risk can be mitigated through five
approaches, used individually or in combination,
to reduce or eliminate losses.
Restricting Development in Landslide-Prone
Areas: Land use planning is one of the most
effective and economical ways of reducing
losses due to landslides by avoiding the hazard
and minimising the risk. This is accomplished by
removing or converting existing developments,
or discouraging or regulating new development
in unstable areas. However, in many states of
India, there are no widely accepted procedures
or regulations with regard to landslides.
Codes for Excavation, Construction, and Grading:
Excavation, construction, and grading codes have
been developed in many countries for construction
in landslide-prone areas. There is no uniform code
to ensure standardisation in India.
Protecting Existing Developments: The
improvement of surface water and groundwater
drainage is the most widely used and generally the
most successful slope-stabilisation method. The
stability of a slope can be increased by removing
all or part of a landslide mass, or by adding earth
buttresses at the toe of potential slope failures.
Restraining walls, piles, caissons, rock anchors,
or soil nailing, are commonly used to prevent
or control slope movement. In most cases, a
combination of these measures is used.
Monitoring and Warning Systems: Monitoring
and warning systems are utilised to protect lives
and property, not to prevent landslides. However,
these systems often provide warning of slope
movement in time to allow the construction of
physical measures that can reduce the immediate
or long-term hazard. Site-specific monitoring
techniques include field observations with various
ground motion measuring instruments such as trip
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
44
wires, radar, laser beams, and vibration meters,
etc. Data from these devices can be telemetered
for real-time warning.
Landslide Insurance and Compensation for Losses:
Landslide insurance would be a logical means to
provide compensation, and an incentive to avoid or
mitigate the hazard. Landslide insurance coverage
could be made a requirement for mortgage loans.
Controls on building, development, and property
maintenance would need to accompany the
mandatory insurance. Insurance and appropriate
government intervention can work together, each
complementing the other in reducing losses and
compensating the victims.
4.2 Landslide Remediation Practices
Already distressed slopes require immediate
landslide remediation intervention. Landslides can
be triggered by various factors such as excessive
rainfall, earthquakes and human interference.
Besides shallow erosion or reduction of shear
strength caused by seasonal rainfall, anthropogenic
activities such as the adding of excessive weight
above the slope, and excavation on the slope
or at the foot of the slope contribute towards
landslide occurrence on a large scale. Different
factors may combine to generate instability, which
in many cases may occur after the lapse of some
time. Mostly it may not be possible to reconstruct
the evolution of the landslide process except
in cases where the site is well-instrumented.
It may also be nearly impossible to stabilise a
failed slope until the morphology of the slide is
understood, the causes responsible for inducing
instability determined, and the resultant risk
assessed, analysed and addressed adequately.
This can be achieved through detailed geological
and geotechnical investigation. Therefore, it is
necessary to conduct detailed investigations
for the planning of remediation measures, as
the extent and nature of the stabilisation to be
implemented will depend mainly on the results of
detailed investigation carried out at the affected
site.
Depending upon the nature and purpose of
the work, degree of risk, and cost effectiveness of
the remediation measures, the slope stabilisation
methods generally include works involving
modification of the natural landslide conditions
such as topography, geology, ground water, and
other conditions that indirectly control portions
of the entire landslide movement. These include
drainage improvement works, soil/debris removal
works, buttress filling works and river training
works.
Drainage works include both—surface and
sub-surface drainage works. Surface drainage
improvement works are implemented to minimise
the infiltration of rain water that builds up pore
pressure. These include two major components,
i.e., drainage collection works and drainage
channel works. Surface drainage measures,
comprising lined catchwater drains above the
crown of a slide, lined contour drains at different
levels of the slide mass, and lined cascading
chute drains, are provided to intercept and divert
rain water from the upslope and slide surface to
reduce infiltration and the development of pore
water pressure substantially. The purpose of subsurface drainage improvement works is to remove
the ground water from within the landslide mass.
These include shallow and deep sub-surface
drainage control works depending upon the nature
of the slide. Sub-surface drainage works may
include intercept under drains, interceptor trench
drains, horizontal gravity drains, drainage wells
and drainage tunnels.
Soil/debris removal works are treatment
measures that yield the most reliable results and
generally can be expected to be very effective in
the case of small to medium sized landslides. The
soil/debris removal or offloading of the slide mass
is generally undertaken from the crown portion
45
downwards and in this process, benches or berms
are created at appropriate intervals depending on
the properties of the material.
In the case of fill works, a buttress fill is placed
at the lower portions of the landslide in order to
provide a counterweight to the landslide mass. It
is most effective if the soil generated by the soil
removal works is used.
Scouring and erosion of the channel bank or
toe of a slope reduces the stability of the slope
and often tends to induce landslide activity. In
such cases, check dams, groundsils and bank
protection can be constructed to prevent further
erosion. If required, deflection spurs are provided
on the upstream of the affected slope.
Provisions of restraining structures rely
directly on the construction of structural elements
with a view to improving the stability of the sliding
mass. These include pile works that act as keys to
tie together the moving landslide and the stable
ground to restrain movement, anchor and bolt
works that utilise the tensile force of anchor bodies
embedded through the slide mass and into stable
earth, and the construction of retaining and breast
walls to prevent smaller sized and secondary
landslides that often occur along the toe portion
of larger landslides.
Once treatment measures have been
implemented on a landslide, the treated slopes
are required to be protected against the effects of
atmospheric elements like rain, snowfall, etc. This
requires minimising the direct exposure of a treated
slope to natural atmospheric processes, which can
be achieved by providing a protective covering
to the treated slope. The covering commonly
provided to slopes includes afforestation, which
not only provides effective covering to slopes but
also improves the shear strength of the material
through root networks. Vegetation can also
be used directly to help stabilise slopes using
biotechnical methods, commonly referred to as
slope bio-engineering. These methods, originally
pioneered in Europe, involve aggressive planting
of carefully selected plants and the construction
of engineered structures using live materials that
will increase in strength over time. Vegetation
can also be effective on steep slopes, where it
intercepts precipitation and reduces both runoff
and excessive infiltration.
Shotcreting with or without a chain link fabric
wire-mesh is very effective in protecting slopes
with weathered rocks. Drainage holes can be
provided along with shotcreting. Covering the
slope surface with geo-fabrics made of natural as
well as synthetic material is also commonly used
in slope protection works.
4.2.1 Landmass Improvement Techniques
The stabilisation of hill slopes is also achieved
by improving the mechanical characteristics of
potentially unstable ground by means of two
different approaches:
i) The insertion of reinforcement elements
into the ground.
ii) The improvement of the mechanical
characteristics of the ground volume
affected by landslides through chemical,
thermal or mechanical treatment.
Reinforcement technology has found wide
application in measures for slope protection.
This can be achieved by the installation of large
diameter wells supported by one or more crowns
of consolidated and possibly reinforced earth
columns, anchors, networks of micro piles,
nailing and grouting with cement or chemical
grouting, depending upon the properties of the
material.
The improvement of the mechanical
characteristics of the ground can also be achieved
Landslide Risk Treatment
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
46
through thermal treatment of potentially unstable
hillsides made up of clayey materials or by
using electro-osmotic treatment in the case of
homogenous clayey ground.
Identified hazardous landslides will be
prioritised and treatment measures implemented
after detailed investigations. The implementation
measures will be supervised by trained
representatives of investigating teams and
monitored for their efficacy.

4.3 Strengthening of Buildings and
Safety of Critical Facilities from
Slides
One of the major concerns of disaster
managers in India is the prevention of deaths
due to the collapse of buildings due to landslides,
earthquakes, or cyclones. We deal with a huge
existing housing stock of questionable safety
and every year we add substantially to that
housing stock a mix of engineered and nonengineered constructions, on already overstressed
slopes. We also have a growing stock of formal
and informal housing, multi-storied buildings,
heritage buildings, bridges, flyovers, and other
infrastructure vulnerable to landslides.
Non-engineered buildings may collapse due
to a large number of causative factors acting
individually or in league with one another. The
super-structure of a building may fail because of
the inadequacy of the design, lack of ductility of
structural members and connections, absence
of shear walls in framed buildings, neglect
of soil structure interaction effects, use of
inappropriate design assumptions, incorrect
choice of construction materials, and faulty
construction.
Even structurally safe buildings may collapse if
their foundations sink, tilt, uplift, and move down
a slope. Failure of the foundation may also be
caused by the liquefaction of the underlying soil
deposit, inadequate foundation, subsidence due
to a collapse of the soil-structure of filled-up areas,
inappropriate choice of foundation, and shoddy
foundation construction.
Strengthening of a building (retrofitting)
means upgrading it to the required design level
to prevent its collapse, while some damage to its
super-structure and foundation may still occur.
The upgrading aims at improving the design of
buildings to bring them in line with the provisions
in the prevailing BIS design codes.
The vulnerability of building foundations
to landslides is an issue on which there is a
lack of sensitivity, absence of initiative and
subdued professional appreciation. No amount
of retrofitting of a superstructure can render a
building safe if its foundations or the slope on
which it rests are vulnerable.
The safety of critical facilities like hospitals,
police stations, schools, etc., against landslides
must be ensured under the worst combination
of forces, including an earthquake tremor. All
new critical facilities should be safeguarded
against multiple hazards, including landslides.
Mainstreaming disaster risk reduction in this way
would ensure that all the critical facilities serve a
disaster reduction function.
Government buildings, hospitals, schools,
archaeological monuments, nuclear structures,
dams, highways, bridges, and commercial
establishments are critical to the national economy
and compete for priority depending on their
relative importance in a given situation. Equal
attention must also be paid to the safety of other
infrastructure such as water pipelines, sewerage
networks, oil pipelines, electrical supply lines,
flyovers, underpasses, metro/rail networks, etc.
47
Their disruption could make disaster management
a difficult task.
4.4 Mitigation Measures for Landslide
Dams
When landslides occur on the slope of a river
valley, the sliding mass may reach the bottom of
the valley and cause partial or complete blockage
of the river channel. This accumulated mass of
landslide debris resulting in blockage of a river is
commonly termed as a landslide dam. The most
common type of mass movements that result
in the formation of landslide dams are rock and
debris avalanches, rock and soil slumps and slides,
and mud, debris, and earth flows.
The formation of a landslide dam is a complex
geodynamic process involving interaction between
the river system and the landslide process. The
geomorphic factors involved in the landslide
damming process are the watershed area,
landslide velocity, nature of the valley slopes, and
width of the valley.
Landslide dams, in general, have been
observed to form in tectonically active areas where
the valleys are narrow, its slopes are steep, and
geomorphological processes are active. The sites
vulnerable to the formation of landslide dams are
characterised by narrow river valleys with steep
slopes requiring a relatively less volume of debris
mass for blockage to occur, and the occurrence
of landslides that cause the movement of huge
volumes of dislodged mass at moderate to high
speed within a short span of time. The formation
of landslide dams the world over is more frequent
in tectonically active areas of crustal shortening
where the rapid uplift of land has provoked the
formation of both large scale slope movements,
and deeply incised and narrow valleys. In the case
of India, the Himalayan region and NER which
are tectonically active and have a concentration
of tectonic stresses, great fault systems and
frequent earthquakes, are areas where landslide
dams have been formed at numerous locales in
the past. Compared to the Himalayas and the NER,
the peninsular shield region is tectonically stable
and the potential of landslide dam occurrence is
very low.
Landslide dams generally occur in areas
receiving high and/or excessive rainfall, rapid
snowmelt and experience moderate to high
magnitude earthquakes.
The immediate impact of landslide dams is the
pondage of water resulting in the submergence
of large upstream areas. The sudden collapse of
the dam body can result in disastrous flash floods
in the lower reaches of the river valley. These
may cause a catastrophic loss of human lives,
settlements, and infrastructural development
that are located nearby in both upstream and
downstream areas of the landslide dam. The
severity of the disaster depends on the height of
the damming structure and the quantity of water
impounded.
If the landslide dam does not fail immediately
or soon after its formation and tends to get
stabilised, then the deposition of the water-borne
sediment load and debris mass from the valley
sides into the dammed lake basin results in river
bed aggradation which may lead to the formation
of deltas or even changing of the river course. In
general, the formation and breaching of landslide
dams takes place within a short span of time;
hence its hazard impact is disastrous both in
upstream and downstream areas. The hazard
potential is maximum when it is not possible to
provide an outlet for the controlled release of
water. In the present scenario, it is difficult to
identify each and every site along river courses that
has a high probability of landslide dam formation.
Studies would have to be carried out to identify
probable sites, especially in those areas which
have a history of landslide dam formation, and
Landslide Risk Treatment
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
48
measures for the prevention thereof would have
to be taken.
In the case of landslide dam formation, the
aim of the mitigation effort is to minimise losses in
case a breach occurs. Considering the immediate
danger of the dam breaching immediately after
its formation, both short-term and long-term
remedial measures are to be contemplated to
save life and property. The immediate measures
will include:
i) In case a report of landslide dam formation
after heavy rainfall/strong earthquake/
rapid snowmelt in hilly areas is received,
the vulnerable areas will be reconnoitred
immediately, if required by helicopter, to
see whether more such landslide dams
have been formed or not. For inaccessible
areas and trans-boundary rivers, the
vulnerable areas will be monitored by the
NRSC through satellites on a real-time
basis. If such an occurrence is noticed, the
situation will be monitored continuously
and information about the developments
will be communicated immediately to the
designated authorities such as the MHA,
NDMA and the concerned SDMAs.
[Action: The CWC in collaboration with the
NRSC; MHA; SDMAs; BRO; IMD.]
ii) The SDMAs will establish and activate the
warning and communications systems
immediately so that information reaches
the last post on a real-time basis and proper
action is taken by all players involved in an
effort to save lives and minimise the loss
to property and infrastructural elements.
[Action: The SDMAs in collaboration with
the BRO.]
iii) Satellite data will be consulted for
understanding the nature of damming.
The pre- and post-occurrence satellite
data would be useful in understanding the
cause of impounding, extent and the areas
affected. This becomes an important tool in
inaccessible areas. Periodic monitoring will
be done using satellite data to understand
the breaching, etc.
iv) A team of experts will reach the affected
site as soon as possible to monitor the
situation, assess the stability status of
the structure and landslide activity, and
changes in water level in the impounded
lake. The teams will implement the required
initial measures to the extent possible
immediately. One of the immediate tasks
will be to establish a communications
link between the site and the designated
authorities. This would help the authorities
to take appropriate decisions related to
preparedness and response whenever
required. If, however, overflow from the
dammed lake has already begun, or the
dammed body is collapsing, then urgent
preventive measures to prevent losses in
downstream areas due to the bursting of
the landslide dam will have to be adopted
on an emergency basis. The status of
landslide activity will be evaluated and if
possible, attempts will be made to release
the impounded water in a controlled way
by creating an outlet. However, the stability
of the structure, changes in water level
and status of landslide activity will be
monitored continuously.
[Action: The CWC in collaboration with the
MoM-GSI; BRO.]
v) If the landslide dam is found to exist
without any immediate threat of failure,
then actions involving preparedness
in the eventuality of an outburst of the
landslide dam, or dam stabilisation,
depending upon site conditions, will be
formulated.
49
vi) Removal measures: If there is negligible
risk of outburst then the landslide dam can
be excavated or blown out with explosives
after assessing the probable impact on
downstream areas, or the dam can be
left as it is without taking any immediate
measures. The partial removal of the
blockage will be in a phased manner to the
extent that the threat to downstream areas
is minimal.
vii) Monitoring the stability status of the
landslide dam, even if it is apparently
found to be stabilised, and the water level
behaviour, will be continued for longer
periods. This can be done through earth
observation systems and by installing
automatic telemetric water level recorders
at site. Similarly, hydrological observations
will be continued by installing automatic
telemetric rain and discharge gauges for
both the upstream and downstream areas
of the site.
[Action: The CWC.]
viii) Assessing the stability of the dam and the
possibility of its failure due to overtopping,
piping, heaving, floods, impact of new
landslides, impact of earthquake, etc.,
through detailed field investigations and
testing of the materials forming the dam.
ix) Evolving remedial measures on the basis
of the probable causes and mechanism
of the collapse of the dammed body in
advance. These should be checked for their
efficiency and implemented as soon as site
conditions are permissible.
x) For assessing the flood hazard posed by
the dam in the event of its breaching by
a landslide, Dam Break Analysis will be
conducted for identifying vulnerable areas.
Communities living in such areas will be
kept in a state of alert as long as the threat
of flash floods exists.
[Action: The CWC in collaboration with the
SDMAs; District Administration.]
The management of landslide dam related
disasters has also been dealt with in the National
Disaster Management Guidelines: Management
of Floods, in section 1.11, p.6.
The lead for these assessment and mitigation
efforts will be taken by the CWC/Ministry of Water
Resources (MoWR) in collaboration with the GSI,
NRSC and the respective state governments.

4.5 Human Settlements in Landslide
Prone Areas
The planning and design of human settlements
in landslide prone areas is a task usually left to
town planners, architects, and engineers. Simple
geological considerations are increasingly being
appreciated in the siting of human settlements.
Architects are generally aware of the special
consideration that goes into the design of human
settlements in the hills vis-à-vis those in the
plains. They, however, need to be educated on
the importance and highly specialised nature of
landslide investigation, mapping and analysis,
which has an impact on both safety and economy.
Human settlements must be viewed not only
from the perspective of their landslide vulnerability,
but also from the perspective of the hazards that
they create or exacerbate.
There is a need to look closely at human
settlements, especially those being built on
problematic slopes by the community. Mitigation
measures, particularly in ecologically fragile hilly
areas, will become much more expensive if new
settlements continue to be built without recourse
to proper slope investigation and timely protective

action, ignoring well known professional practices
in landslide risk management.
Projects like the Prime Minister’s Grameen
Sadak Yojna and the Jawaharlal Nehru National
Urban Renewal Mission, envisaging wide coverage
and huge investment, provide a great opportunity
for improving the safety of constructions against
landslides in hilly areas.
Site selection for housing, human settlements
and other infrastructure in hilly areas will be done
by a highly competent multi-disciplinary team
of experts aiming to preserve the texture of the
place and its cultural fabric, maintaining balance
between natural and anthropogenic factors. These
Guidelines aim to remove the points of conflict
between the growing developmental compulsions
of sluggish economies in the hilly areas and the
applicable techno-financial and techno-legal
regimes. A casual approach to site selection and
planning will be discouraged to facilitate wellinformed decision making based on systematically
conducted investigations.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with the
TAC and in collaboration with the SDMAs; MoM-GSI;
MoEF; Archaeological Survey of India (ASI); CoA.]
The experiences with human settlements in
hilly regions, especially in the states of Jammu and
Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar
Pradesh, Arunanchal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya,
Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Assam, Goa,
Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu,
and the Union Territories of Puducherry and the
Andaman and Nicobar group of islands, tell us that
the problems of human settlements in mountain
regions are those of staggering imbalances
in growth patterns, varying levels of natural
hazards, environmental degradation, the degree of
deforestation, high cost of construction, paucity of
building materials, uneasy access to appropriate
technologies, economic backwardness, lack of
entrepreneurship, and the slow pace of social
change.
The growing population density, fuelled in
some places by increasing tourism, has generated
an additional pressure of human settlements
on the already fragile slopes. The techno-legal
regime will be tightened to strictly regulate
new construction, in accordance with approved
development plans.
Numerous human settlements are frequently
seen on valley floors, particularly alongside rivers
and close to their tributaries, as also around
lakes and water bodies. Many of these locations
are highly prone and vulnerable to the multiple
hazards of landslides, earthquakes, floods, and
cloudbursts.
Indiscriminate quarrying and mining operations
for construction material have also become a
cause for serious concern in the hills, and will be
strictly regulated.
4.6 Protection of Heritage Structures
The protection of cultural heritage from natural
hazards is an issue of worldwide concern, both
in developed as well as in developing countries.
The damage caused to heritage structures
by natural disasters is increasing as both the
vulnerability of rapidly developing urban areas
and the consequences of climate change tend to
amplify the effects caused by their occurrence.
Within this framework, landslides represent a
major threat, both to the safety of people and the
preservation of the built environment, including
many important heritage sites of national,
international, cultural, or natural value. Although
the concept of preservation has already taken hold
in many countries, the situation is more serious
in developing countries where awareness of the
unique value represented by cultural heritage and
51
the economic, scientific, and technical means for
mitigating landslide hazard are limited.
The safety of many of our heritage buildings as
well as lifeline structures stands visibly threatened
by landslides and other types of disasters. In many
cases the slopes supporting them are neglected.
In some other cases only piecemeal efforts are
being made to contain the problem, with partial
success.
Close interaction with agencies like the ASI,
Indian National Trust for Archaeological and Cultural
Heritage (INTACH) and archaeological departments
of the states will be developed to prepare lists of
structures/sites which are at risk due to landslides/
slope stability problems, and to prioritise them.
Based on this priority list, further studies and
works for hazard mitigation will be taken up by the
appropriate authorities in collaboration with the
ASI, INTACH and the archeological departments
of the state governments.

5.1 Introduction
Monitoring is an important component of
landslide investigation/studies that includes the
measurement and analysis of landslide dynamics
as well as changes in the factors that cause
landslides. It is also necessary some times to
undertake post-stabilisation monitoring of a
landslide to evaluate the efficacy of the remedial
measures implemented. Most landslide monitoring
programmes include real-time, continuous (or at
relatively close intervals) measurement of the
temporal and spatial variability of mass movements
at and beneath the surface, micro-topography, soil
moisture, ground water levels, and precipitation.
Typically, these measurements are collected at
a central data recording and transmission point
on the site. This data is often used in landslide
warning systems in high-risk areas.
Landslide monitoring is generally not practiced
in our country. Considering the incidence of a
huge number of landslides in the Himalayas, NER,
Western Ghats and Nilgiri hills in South India, it
is not possible to undertake monitoring of each
individual landslide. Therefore, a few landslides
will be identified for monitoring and early warning.
5.2 Monitoring of Landslides
The monitoring of landslide movements
consists of:
i) Selecting a specific location depending
upon the type of movement, location,
hazard, and risk value of slope failure.
ii) Selection of monitoring methods and
frequency of data collection.
iii) Data processing and methods of result
presentation.
Methods generally used for monitoring
landslides can be divided into surface and subsurface measurements of the landslide activity,
and total regime measurements.
5.2.1 Surface Measurements of Landslide
Activity
A simple method of monitoring is through
the installation of a few survey pillars within the
landslide zone and on its periphery, linked with
a few reference pillars installed on undisturbed
and stable ground. Periodic observations of the
relative position and top level of survey pillars,
particularly in the pre-monsoons, and during
high rainfall and post-monsoon periods give a
fairly good idea about the extent and rate of
surface movement of the landslide, the amount
of subsidence, and also surface stress variations.
The rainfall data, particularly the intensity of the
rainfall should be collected from nearby rain gauge
stations and an effort may be made to correlate the
intensity of rainfall data with the time of initiation
of the mobilisation event. The measurement of
cracks on the slope surface and their development
provides a very useful input for slope stability
analysis.
5.2.2 Sub-Surface Measurements of
Landslide Activity
Sub-surface measurements of landslide
activity are carried out by installing different types
of instruments in boreholes drilled at various
identified locations. The shallow sub-surface
5 Landslide Monitoring
 and Forecasting
53
Landslide Monitoring and Forecasting
movements, including creep are measured
by installing flexible casings in boreholes and
observing their behaviour—through SGI rod
inclinometers, Kirby’s T-pegs, and strain probes.
Movements at deeper depths are monitored
through chain deflect meters, single or multi-drill
hole extensometers; single and multi-point wire
extensometers; pipe strain meters and insert-type
pipe strain meters. However, slope indicators
and inclinometers are the most extensively used
instruments used for monitoring sub-surface
movements in landslides.
The geophysical method of measuring pulse
electromagnetic emissions identifies zones of
high stress concentration in the body of the
landslide. The measurements can be taken in with
inclinometer boreholes.
5.2.3 Total Regime Measurements
Total regime measurements include recording
fluctuations in the behaviour of ground water,
which is most often the principal cause of
landsliding. The purpose of these observations
is to record changes in ground water levels,
yield of water and the consequent development
of pore pressure in the landslide material. The
behaviour of ground water in the landslide area
can be measured and monitored by installing
piezometers at different depths in the boreholes.
Various types of piezometers are used, of which
hydraulic piezometers, pneumatic piezometers
and electrical piezometers are the most commonly
used. Of late, tensometers are used for the
measurement of pore water pressure in many
countries.
Rainfall records are required to develop
correlations between rainfall, slope movement
and pore pressures in the landslide mass and also
the impact of these on the initiation of landslide
activity. The rainfall should be measured by
installing automatic rain gauges at the landslide
locations.
5.2.4 Real-Time Monitoring of Landslides
Simple monitoring of landslides, with or
without instrumentation, cannot detect changes
at the time of initiation of the mobilisation
event, while real-time landslide monitoring
can continuously pick up even minor changes,
enabling the transmission of warning signals just
at the time of initiation of a landslide movement.
The continuous data provided by real-time
monitoring through a remote station permits
better understanding of the dynamic behaviour
of a landslide. With the rapid advances made in
electronics and communications technology, it
has become possible to monitor the behaviour
of a landslide continuously and transmit data to
processing locations on a real-time basis. All the
instruments are connected to data loggers located
in the vicinity of the sites being monitored. These
data loggers are connected to data processing
stations through telemetry systems that can
transmit data to processing stations on a real-time
basis. The data thus obtained can be processed
automatically and immediately by computers
having the necessary software installed. The
results can be utilised for maintaining records or
issuing warnings as per requirements.
Increasingly, remote sensing application
tools, including High Resolution Satellite Imagery,
LiDAR, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Persistent
Scatterer (PS), and differential interferometery
techniques for the correlation between landslide
morphology, motion and topographic analysis are
used in some countries for landslide monitoring.
This has facilitated predictive modelling and risk
analysis of landslides.
These and related studies demonstrate the
high potential of using new technologies for
landslide studies. Clearly, the advances of the
past two decades in remote sensing, digital image
processing, GPS, and GIS are revolutionising the
study of landslides and improving the ability of
scientific and government agencies to monitor and
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
54
manage landslide-prone areas. In particular, GPS
can play an important role in monitoring landslideprone areas for signs of current movement, and
provide near real-time warning on motion of
landslides that can endanger life and property.
With the advent of multi-antenna GPS instruments,
the cost of monitoring with GPS has come
down substantially. High resolution imagery and
topographic mapping can lead to an improved
understanding of landslide mechanics and hazard
prediction. Continued research into methods
of data collection, processing, and synthesis
is needed to realise the full potential of these
technologies for worldwide use in the coming
decades.
Real-time monitoring of landslides has
generally not been practised in India till recently.
As real-time monitoring of landslide is a costly
procedure involving a high amount of risk of losing
expensive instruments due to the active nature of
the landslide, only landslides having the potential
to collapse catastrophically with a threat to life
and property should be identified and monitored
on a real-time basis.
5.3 Early Warning Systems for
Landslides
In a holistic sense, the term early warning
includes the whole range of actions and operations
right from planning and instrumentation of
problematic slopes and landslides to their
monitoring, analysis, fixing of early warning alert
thresholds, decision making, dissemination of
early warning alerts and continuous improvement
in early warning practices through sustained
location-specific feedback and new research.
The effects of landslides can be mitigated to
some extent or minimised in certain cases, if the
communities threatened by them are forewarned
about the impending disaster and are prepared
to face them.
There are no standard readymade packages
or systems for early warning but all the
instrumentation, tools, equipment, observation,
and data processing systems are available in
a range of varieties. They are necessarily to be
fashioned to suit a particular slope or a landslide
according to the type, magnitude, hazard potential
of the landslide, and the purpose of the early
warning alert. Hazard detection and early warning
systems for different types of landslides are
also usually different. For example, planning
for instrumentation and early warning for a preexisting (repetitive) landslide will be very different
from the schemes for early warning against
anticipated first time landslides. Likewise, early
warning schemes for mass movements such as
debris flows or rock falls will be very different from
those for a block slide or classical landslide with
discrete boundary shears. The task of evolving
an early warning system in a given situation will
necessarily have to be assigned to experts.
Early warning is a process which involves
three components:
Scientific and Technical Communities: These are
responsible for studying and monitoring natural
events to provide models which can be used to
forecast events in terms of intensity, time, and
geographical span.
Government Authorities and Civil Agencies:
These are responsible for establishing operations,
and the framework related to preparedness and
response in case of events.
Local Communities: The local communities
must understand the nature of the hazards,
their possible intensities and ranges, and react
according to existing guidelines provided by the
institutions identified by the authorities.
People-centred early warning systems
empower the communities to prepare for and
55
confront the fury of natural disasters. These bring
safety, security and peace of mind to the people.
Effective early warning systems can provide
resilience to natural hazards and protect economic
assets and developmental gains.
A complete and effective early warning system
comprises four inter-related elements:
i) Risk knowledge: Prior knowledge of the
risks faced by communities.
ii) Monitoring and warning services: Technical
and warning services for these risks.
iii) Dissemination and communication:
Dissemination of easy to understand
warnings to those at risk.
iv) Response capability: Knowledge,
awareness and preparedness to act.
The weakness or failure of any one of them
could result in the failure of the entire system.
5.3.1 Risk Knowledge
The development of effective warnings
depends on the generation of accurate risk
scenarios showing the potential impact of hazards
on vulnerable groups. The acceptable levels of risk
to communities can be a factor in determining
whether and when warnings are to be issued to
communities. The determination of this factor
requires capabilities of analysis not only of the
hazards, but also the vulnerabilities to the hazards,
and the consequential risks.
The development of early warning systems
requires access to high-quality data on the
magnitude, duration, location, and timing of hazard
events to be able to extract information on hazard
frequency and severity from observational data
sets. This requires:
i) Continuous, systematic and consistent
observation of the parameters related to
the hazard.
ii) Proper arrangements for data storage.
iii) Capacities to locate and retrieve the
required data and freely disseminate the
same to public users.
iv) Sufficient dedicated resources to support
these activities.
It is necessary that in addition to gathering
data on risk factors, the risk assessment exercises
should involve local communities to determine
their perceived risks and concerns as well as
their existing preparedness. Participatory risk
assessment also allows for the formal integration
of traditional knowledge into risk assessment and
early warning systems.
The main challenges for the development of
early warning systems for landslides include:
i) Establishing and maintaining monitoring,
observational, and data management
systems at identified locations.
ii) Constructing a history of the hazard at
selected locations.
iii) Obtaining systematic social and environmental data for vulnerability assessment.
5.3.2 Monitoring and Warning Systems
The disaster management network has to
harness the local knowledge based warning
systems for landslide hazards. The monitoring
of hazardous locales by educated, aware, and
sensitised communities is the most valuable
and reliable information base for developing an
effective early warning system. Local committees
or groups have to be identified and trained to
discern early warning signs, gather information
and disseminate them to the appropriate DM cells.
There have been marked improvements
in the quality, timeliness and lead time of
hazard warnings, mainly driven by scientific
and technological advances. This is particularly
Landslide Monitoring and Forecasting
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
56
due to rapid advances in computer systems
and communications technology. There have
been continuous improvements in the accuracy
and reliability of monitoring instruments, and
in integrated observation networks, particularly
through the use of remote sensing techniques.
In turn, these have supported research on hazard
phenomena, modelling and forecasting methods
and warning systems. While the capabilities for
identifying areas of landslide hazard occurrence
exist at the global level, the capabilities for
predicting the time of its occurrence are still
developing. The signs of an impending disaster
can often be detected at an early stage and used
for warning. It may be possible to predict the
time of occurrence of a landslide in some cases,
provided the slopes are monitored.
As discussed above, identifying the incipient
instability of slopes and early warning of ensuing
landslides is possible through systematic mapping,
slope instrumentation, monitoring and real-time
data analysis. Modern technology offers a number
of high resolution instruments that can capture,
monitor and transmit data for real-time analysis
and forecasting.
There is a notion among non-professionals
that early warning systems for slope failures
and landslides are always sophisticated and
expensive. The fact, however, is that in many
situations, simple, inexpensive instruments can
be used for easily measurable indicators that can
provide premonitions of impending slope failure.
Monitoring of rainfall, surface and sub-surface
slope movements, slope subsidence, slope heave,
development and widening of cracks, tilting of
trees and poles, sudden oozing out of water or
drying of water springs, sub slope piping, under
slope erosion, sudden boulder falls, cracking
of building floors, and other such events often
provide irrefutable evidence of unsatisfactory
slope behaviour. Randomly picked isolated
observations of this kind do not convey much but
when all such evidence is collected, analysed, and
connected with other inputs, early warning alerts
become possible.
Guidelines and field manuals will be formulated and
workshops and training programmes organised for
different target groups. Actual projects will be
encouraged to create pace setter examples of
early warning as well as for training professionals
on the projects.
[Action: The DST in collaboration with the NIDM;
WIHG; CDMM; IITs, universities, and other
academic institutions.]
Simple devices commonly used for early
warning against landslides in the recent past are:
i) Wire or special switches, actuated by the
pressure of moving debris coupled to a
decision-support system that releases early
warning alerts.
ii) Electrical switch poles which turn to an
upright position upon displacement.
iii) Photo-electrical barriers, especially for
rapidly moving debris flows or earth flows.
iv) Pulsed radar for snow avalanches.
v) Fibre optic sensors and technology.
vi) Acoustic emission technology.
vii) Auto-actuated photographic systems.
viii) GPS observations.
Projects will be encouraged to develop
appropriate technologies as well as to effectively
utilise the available state-of-the-art technologies
to facilitate quality monitoring in a cost-effective
manner, aiming at real-time early warning.

the TAC and in collaboration with the MoM-GSI;

While capabilities exist at the global level
to identify areas of landslide occurrence, the
capability of predicting their occurrence is still
developing. The signs of impeding landslides
can often be detected at an early stage and used
for warning affected communities. The time
of landslide occurrence is possible to predict
provided the slopes are monitored continuously.
Advances in monitoring technology, particularly
in real-time transmission of information have
enhanced the techniques of short-term prediction,
and examples of the same are available in limited
numbers. The best example of this is the early
warning system established for the Yangtze River
valley in China that uses 70 stations, employing
over 300 professionals for monitoring. The network
protects a population of 3,00,000 and has so far
forecast 217 landslides and avoided estimated
economic losses of US$ 27 million.
Remote sensing, GPS, and GIS are now
mature technologies that can be used to monitor
landslides and landslide prone areas with greater
accuracy than could be accomplished previously
with field reconnaissance alone. Recent studies
have used these tools, including high-resolution
satellite imagery, and LiDAR. High resolution
imagery and topographic mapping can lead to an
improved understanding of landslide mechanics
and hazard prediction. Continued research into
methods of data collection, processing and
synthesis is needed to realise the full promise
of these technologies for use worldwide in the
coming decades.
Radar is one of the technological advances
that can be used for monitoring landslides
effectively. Some applications of radar include
monitoring of avalanche movement, detection of
crevasses in geological formations, measuring
the thickness of snow on roads to facilitate snow
clearance operations and aiding the search for
avalanche victims.
Recent developments in remote sensing of
weather information have provided the capability
for more timely and spatially accurate assessments
and warnings of weather-related hazards. Remote
sensing of rainfall using Doppler Radar and Infrared
Satellite Sensing (DrISS) can provide information on
rainfall with a spatial and temporal resolution that is
potentially useful for near real-time landslide hazard
assessment and warning. Thresholds of rainfall
intensity and duration for triggering of landslides
have been developed for many regions worldwide
using ground-based rainfall measurement and
documentation of landslides. Rainfall thresholds
have been applied for regional real-time landslide
warning systems. However, techniques for
analysing the temporal variation in slope stability
on a local scale during the course of a storm with
interval rainfall input are now being developed.
The automatic weather station developed by the
Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) can
also be deployed in remote areas for collecting
meteorological parameters and transmitting the
same through different networks like VSAT, VPN, etc.
A great majority of dormant landslides often
turn active and violent during the monsoon
season, and high intensity short duration rainfall
events are generally responsible for triggering
catastrophic landslides. This single observation is
enough to underscore the importance of reliable
and continuous rainfall measurements and realtime analysis of rainfall data, preferably at all major
landslide sites. Rainfall information will be utilised
for developing indicators for landslide alerts,
especially for high landslide hazard areas prone
to cloudbursts and high intensity short duration
rainfalls. For example, the eastern Himalayas get
very heavy monsoon rainfall punctuated with
occasional cloudbursts with rainfall intensities in
the range of 300 mm per day to 1,000 mm per
day (the higher the rainfall intensity, the lesser its
duration). One study developed on this observation
in the 1980s led to the linking of landsliding with

The prediction of landslides is possible and
R&D work on it deserves to be encouraged.
Attempts to predict landslides have so far been
based on the time-dependent displacement
behaviour of landslides, generally in the tertiary
stage of the creep. The increasing availability of
high resolution geospatial maps and powerful
slope instrumentation techniques make real-time
landslide prediction possible.
R&D projects on landslide prediction will be
encouraged. One major research programme on
landslide prediction and early warning installations
with the provision of comprehensive scientific
study and geotechnical instrumentation will be
undertaken to create pace setter examples.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with the
TAC and in collaboration with the CSIO; CDMM;
CBRI; CRRI; IITs, universities, and other academic
institutions.]
Once a decision for early warning is taken
based on the available information inputs, the early
warning dissemination strategy will be common
to that prescribed for other types of disasters.
Operations such as post early warning interfacing
with communities, press, and the media are
common to all types of disasters. Integrated early
warning dissemination systems will be evolved.
Technologies are available where a Short Message
Service (SMS) can be simultaneously translated
into 14 languages.
Even with the best of early warning systems,
the results will still be catastrophic if early
warning signals are not properly interpreted and
communities are not educated and trained on how
to respond to early warning alerts in real-time.
There should be an easily understandable manual
clearly bringing out what to do in case an early
warning system flashes such an alert. Quite often
the corresponding rainfall event coefficient (ratio of
the rainfall of an event to the mean annual rainfall
at the location). The findings revealed that event
coefficients exceeding 20 per cent trigger heavy
landslides at all times. A very high probability of
landslides was projected for event coefficients
of 10–20 per cent. The probability of landslides
was rated as very low when the event coefficient
fell below 5 per cent. The above study is only
suggestive of the nature of advanced studies to
be undertaken, and it is important to encourage
such studies and make them more scientific and
systematic. The statistical correlation between
rainfall and the corresponding slope surface and
sub-surface movements, and the measurement
of pore water pressure development within the
slope provide a good insight into slope behaviour.
Early warning thresholds for well-studied
seasonal (repetitive) rain-induced landslides
on discrete boundary shears with known pore
pressure variations on the landslide boundaries are
the most reliable. Such early warning thresholds
usually take advantage of the unique, linear
relationship between the factor of safety (in terms
of effective stress) and the pore water pressure
(considered in terms of ratio).
Since the inter-relationship between rainfall
intensity, slope surface and sub-slope movements,
and pore pressures provide a powerful means for
reliable landslide forecasting, studies regarding
this will be encouraged. Rainfall and the associated
slope behavioural information will be utilised for
developing indicators for landslide alerts, especially
for high landslide hazard areas known to succumb
to cloudbursts and high intensity short duration
rainfall. In cases where no such information is
available, a warning of a general nature and low
reliability may still be possible through the study
of rainfall records in the backdrop of the previous
landslide history.
[Action: The MoM in consultation with the TAC
and in collaboration with the IMD; MoM-GSI;
59
the early warning alert may be lost in panic and
confusion, if people are not aware of the response
that must follow such alerts.
Studies are being carried out in many countries
to establish the correlation between the intensity
of rainfall and initiation of slides in different
regions. Once the threshold values of rainfall
at which landslides are initiated in a particular
area are known, the same can be used as a
basis for issuing early warnings if the amount of
rainfall in that particular area can be forecast. The
correlations can be established with the help of
past records as well as monitoring. In our country,
the IMD and National Centre for Medium Range
Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) have developed
the capability of forecasting the amount of rainfall
an area is likely to receive 3–5 days in advance.
Collaborative efforts in this field can be made
to establish the rainfall thresholds required to
initiate landslides in some pilot areas. Once these
are established, they can serve as early warning
systems for those particular areas. Depending on
the success of this study, some more landslide
prone areas may be selected for developing early
warning systems.
Public response to a forecast is another
difficult area. If the people are not educated, they
will interpret the same forecast differently. If not
fully aware of the lethal consequences, they will
generally take warnings lightly. Disaster education
must eliminate such possibilities.
5.3.3 Dissemination and Communication
Dissemination and communication
mechanisms, as far as early warning systems
are concerned, must be operational, robust,
and available round the clock. These should be
designed to the meet the needs of a wide range of
different threats and different user communities.
The dissemination of information must be
based on clear protocols and procedures and
supported by an adequate telecommunications
infrastructure. At the national level, effective
dissemination and communication mechanisms
are required to ensure timely dissemination of
information to the authorities and communities
at risk in even the most remote areas of the
country. Each area may require different
technological infrastructure to allow for the
effective dissemination of messages. To ensure
that all systems work smoothly in tandem, they
will be based on internationally agreed standards.
At the national level, the effectiveness of
warnings depends on their timely and effective
dissemination to all at risk, particularly through
operational telecommunications systems, but
also through non-technical social networks. The
latter are very important in poor communities that
lack modern communication systems. Effective
dissemination requires the establishment of
a chain of command in advance, to manage
warning issuance and dissemination, to ensure
that information provided can be understood by
those who need it and it reaches all the affected
locations in the country. It is more important in the
case of landslides as they are localised events and
can occur in remote locations.
A typical warning dissemination chain involves
channelling of warnings from technical and
scientific sources through government decision
makers and the media to multiple receivers who
may also function as onward disseminators.
Such users include emergency services, security
agencies, operators of utilities, information
and communication services, other economic
service providers, NGOs, voluntary agencies,
and vulnerable communities. In a system with
integrated disaster management structures,
the principal agencies responsible for issuing
warnings and the processes for their issuance
will be established by prior agreement. Various
players are involved in generating warnings,
including the private sector in developed countries
and civil defence sector in others. To be effective,
Landslide Monitoring and Forecasting
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
60
early warning activities must equally cover all the
relevant areas in the country. In order to reach
all those who need to take action, there is a
need to design warnings for particular groups of
stakeholders, such as different language groups,
people with disabilities, and tourists. The public
broadcast media remain the most widely used
mode worldwide, which is appropriate as the
best systems for warning dissemination are
those used everyday and with which the users are
most familiar. The role of community-based and
grassroots organisations, as well as NGOs and
other players in disseminating warnings is pivotal.
5.3.4 Response Capability
Response to early warnings involves activating
coping mechanisms (mainly for the orderly
movement of people away from locales at risk,
seeking shelter, and safely securing assets) before
a disaster strikes. In contrast, the post-disaster
response implies the wider range of recovery,
rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in the
aftermath of the disaster. However, both are a part
of disaster preparedness and employ common
emergency procedures. Warnings of hazard
events must be issued with clear instructions
about the most appropriate actions to be taken
to avoid losses as far as possible. The success
of early warning depends on the extent to
which it triggers effective response measures
and therefore warning systems will include
preparedness strategies and plans to ensure an
effective response to warning messages.
Warnings trigger a variety of responses from
different agencies at various levels, which must be
coordinated. A number of governmental agencies,
including various ministries, institutions, national
disaster management institutions, and municipal
and local administration authorities, are responsible
for coordinating disaster preparedness. People are
more likely to listen to and act upon warnings
when they have been educated about their risks
and warning reaction plans are in place.
5.4 Pilot Studies for Instrument
Based Early Warning
A few landslides will be identified for
instrumentation based early warning in consultation
with state governments and other Central
Government agencies like the BRO. It will be a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional approach. Efforts
will be made to integrate local communities and the
concerned state governments in this endeavour.
Projects aimed at early warning against major
landslides will be encouraged, taking advantage
of the fact that unlike many other disasters, early
warnings against landslides are possible with the
present state-of-the-art technologies.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the SDMAs;
BRO; MoM-GSI; DST; District Administrations;
IITs, universities, and other academic institutions.]
Pilot projects will also be launched to arrive at
early warning thresholds through the correlation
between rainfall intensity and landslide initiation.
In this case, three to four areas in different parts
of the country, like the Western Himalayas,
Eastern Himalayas or the NER and the Western
Ghats or Nilgiris, where the density of landslide
incidence and rainfall are high, can be selected
in consultation with either the IMD or NCMRWF.
The latter has developed weather forecasting
capability for particular areas within grids of 150
km by 150 km, three to five days in advance. These
grids are being redefined to blocks of 100 km
by 100 km. The rainfall threshold values needed
for landslide activation in the particular pilot
areas will be established through earlier records
and continued monitoring. The results of these
observations will be matched with the weather
forecasts made by the above organisations. Once
these correlations are established, the forecasts
issued by the IMD or NCMRWF will be utilised
for issuing early warnings for possible landslide
occurrence in those particular areas.
61
[Action: The IMD in collaboration with the
NCMRWF; MoM-GSI; DST; CDMM; CBRI; CWC;
IITs, universities, and other academic institutions.]
For correlating rainfall intensity and landslide
initiation to develop forecast capabilities, 20 predetermined landslide locations will be monitored
initially with automatic rain gauges by different
agencies. This national initiative will be closely
coupled and eventually integrated into the ongoing
programme of expansion of the automatic rain
gauge network of the IMD.
[Action: The IMD in collaboration with the MoMGSI; DST; CDMM; CBRI; CWC; IITs, universities,
and other academic institutions.]
Both the pilot projects of developing early
warning systems for specific landslides or specific
areas may take about five years to complete.
Depending upon the results of these pilot studies,
more areas will be taken up for the development
of such systems.

6.1 Introduction
The state governments/SDMAs of landslide
affected areas in consultation with the NDMA
will establish the necessary techno-legal and
techno-financial mechanisms to address the
problem of landslide hazards in their respective
states. This is to ensure that all stakeholders like
builders, architects, engineers, and government
departments responsible for regulation and
enforcement adopt landslide safe land use
practices and provide for safety norms as far as
slope stability is concerned in landslide affected
areas in particular and hilly areas in general.
[Action: State governments/SDMAs; district
administrations; the CoA.]
6.2 Model Town Planning and Land
Use Bye-Laws
In recognition of the importance of a
techno-legal framework for regulating the built
environment, the MHA constituted a national level
expert group to recommend modifications to the
existing regulations to ensure structural safety.
This group recommended modifications to
the town and country planning acts, land use
and zoning regulations, Development Control
Regulations (DCRs) and building bye-laws, and
developed a set of model bye-laws which are
technically rigorous and conform to globally
accepted norms. They also prescribed regulatory,
quality control and compliance mechanisms. The
MHA has circulated these model bye-laws to the
state governments for a review of the bye-laws
currently in force and for ensuring their adoption
after revision.
The following codes and guidelines related
to landslides have been finalised and published
by the BIS.
i) IS 14496 (Part 2): 1998 Guidelines for the
preparation of LHZ maps in mountainous
terrain: Part 2: Macro Zonation.
ii) IS 14458: Guidelines for Retaining Walls
for Hilly Areas.
a. Part 1: Selection of the Type of Walls.
b. Part 2: Design of Retaining/Breast
Walls.
c. Part 3: Construction of Dry Stone
Walls.
iii) IS 14680:1999: Guidelines for Landslide
Control.
iv) IS 14804:2000: Guidelines for Siting,
Design and Selection of Materials for
Residential Buildings in Hilly Areas.
v) National Building Code (NBC) 2005.
Part 2: Macro Zonation, dealing with guidelines
for the preparation of LHZ maps in mountainous
terrain is under revision and the guidelines for LHZ
mapping at the meso-scale are under preparation.
It is essential that the above codes are
critically examined and urgently reviewed by
peers in the context of global and indigenous
research as well as the growing pool of knowledge
and experience gained in pursuing indigenous
6 Regulation and Enforcement
63
Regulation And Enforcement
mapping programmes. Once the initial revisions
are carried out in the next two years, the BIS will
revise/revalidate these every five years or earlier,
if necessary.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with the
TAC and in collaboration with the BIS.]
It is also felt that there should be codes/
guidelines in the case of landslides risk evaluation
and the detailed geological investigation of
landslides.
In case of hydropower projects in hilly terrain,
all the agencies involved, whether in the private or
public sector, need to follow these guidelines for
the preparation of landslide susceptibility, hazard
and risk analysis and risk analysis maps, and to
obtain clearance from the concerned authorities
before initiating the project.
Model Village Planning and Land Use Bye-Laws
To ensure structural safety at the village
level in mountainous terrains, a techno-legal
framework akin to town planning bye-laws needs
to be developed, which will translate and codify
landslide concerns into village development.
Appropriate legislation may be considered
for the enactment for future safe and planned
development in towns and villages affected by
landslide hazard.
6.3 Indian Standard Codes
The non-availability of the latest codes,
guidelines and standards has been frequently
cited as one of the major constraints responsible
for the poor implementation of codal provisions.
Considering the overriding interest of public safety,
the BIS will place all Indian standards related to
landslides in the public domain including the
Internet for free download.
[Action: The BIS.]
A periodic revision of the codes and standards
relating to landslides will be undertaken by drafting
groups within a fixed time-frame of five years or
even earlier on a priority basis.
Other than the BIS, there are a number of other
bodies that develop design codes and guidelines
in the country, e.g., the Indian Roads Congress
(IRC), Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and
Highways (MoSRTH), Research Designs and
Standards Organisation (RDSO), and Ministry
of Railways (MoR). Codes developed by these
organisations will also be updated and made
consistent with current state-of-the-art techniques
on landslide safety. These agencies also have a
number of internal memos for the regulation of
construction practices, the review of which will
also be undertaken at the earliest.
[Action: The BIS.]
The nodal agency and the BIS will ensure that
the relevant national code writing bodies prepare
action plans to carry out regular revisions of the
existing codes and for soliciting draft provisions
for discussion on new codes to be developed.
The BIS is the nodal agency for preparing
codes related to landslide studies, procedures
and other safety related codes. Many codes and
guidelines are in place, some are under revision
and others still need to be formulated.
The BIS will ensure the finalisation and
formulation of all pending codes and guidelines
within the next two years.
[Action: The BIS.]

6.4 Techno-Legal Regime
The techno-legal regime for landslide risk
management will cover both technical and legal
issues together for the effective regulation,
implementation and management of landslide
risks.
All future developmental activities will be
regulated by codal provisions which will prescribe
all the disaster resistant features. India does not
have any major provisions or good enforcement
systems to ensure disaster resistant construction
for landslides. It should be emphasised that it is not
disasters that cause loss of life and property, but
badly planned and/or adversely located structures.
This can be dealt with by adopting a technolegal regime through the introduction of disaster
resistant planning features in development and
building regulations.
The DM Act, 2005 has clearly defined the
institutional and coordination mechanisms at
the national, state, district and local levels, and
provides for the establishment of a Disaster
Mitigation Fund and Disaster Response Fund
at these levels. The Act also provides for legal
powers and penalties. The provisions included in
the Act are valid throughout the country.
The state governments/SDMAs will adopt
the model techno-legal framework for ensuring
compliance with land use zoning and landslide
safety issues in all development activities and
plans. State governments will update the urban
and land use regulations by amending them to
incorporate multi-hazard safety requirements.
They will also review, revise and update the town
and country planning Acts, land use and zoning
regulations, building bye-laws, and DCRs, and
this process will be repeated at regular intervals.
[Action: State governments in collaboration with
the SDMAs; district administrations.]
6.5	 Licensing and Certification
All professionals dealing with the safety
aspects of slopes in hilly areas will be trained and
sensitised through a capacity building process
initially, and certified through a licensing process
after this. Such certification requirements, in
accordance with the criteria evolved by the model
techno-legal regime, will be incorporated in the
DCRs. Engineering geologists and engineers
working with the GoI and state government
organisations will also be subject to this
certification.
The NDMA and the nodal agency, in
collaboration with the relevant ministries and
departments of the GoI will evolve an appropriate
techno-legal framework for making the licensing
of professionals mandatory.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the central
ministries.]
In the case of architects and town planners,
the statutory body for registering architects,
namely the Council of Architecture (CoA) and the
professional body that coordinates with architects,
namely the Indian Institute of Architects (IIA), will
be responsible for the registration, training and
upgradation of the skills of architects and town
planners in landslide safety and construction.
[Action: All India Council for Technical Education
(AICTE) in collaboration with IITs, universities and other
academic institutions; the CoA; IIA; urban planners.]
6.6 Compliance Review
A sound compliance regime is required to
ensure the effectiveness of legal provisions. It is
most important that monitoring, verification and
compliance arrangements are in place both at the
national and state levels.
65
All land use and developmental plans in hilly
areas will go through a mandatory compliance
review by professionals of the Urban Local
Bodies (ULBs) and PRIs to which these are to
be submitted for approval. Major projects and
critical structures will be put through a mandatory
compliance review by qualified external agencies.
[Action: District administrations in collaboration
with urban planners; ULBs; CoA; IIA; PRIs.]
The model techno-legal regime recommended
by the expert group set up by the MHA will be
incorporated in the DCRs to enforce the scrutiny
of developmental and land use plans in hilly areas
for their compliance with safety requirements
in accordance with the DCRs. This scrutiny will
be applicable to all construction habitations
and structures in both urban and rural areas.
State governments, in consultation with their
State Executive Committee (SEC) and Hazard
Safety Cells (HSCs), will ensure that the bodies
responsible for compliance are equipped with
qualified professionals to undertake general
compliance reviews. These professionals, who
may be government employees or accredited
private practitioners, will be trained specifically in
ensuring compliance with the bye-laws. MoM, in
consultation with GSI, and the state governments,
and other agencies concerned, will develop a
checklist of items to be verified and the method
for such verification at national level consultative
workshops and use them as training inputs.
The area selected for the expansion of human
settlements, industrial clusters, and other important
projects in hilly areas will be assessed by regarding
the status of slope stability by accredited agencies
or professionals for their safety. A procedure will
be developed by the state government/SDMA
concerned for undertaking this assessment by
accredited agencies for ensuring safety.
6.7 Technical Audits and Monitoring
All existing habitations and important
structures located in vulnerable areas and facing
high risk from unstable slopes will be monitored
by ULBs. The slope stability assessment reports
and treatment requirements, if needed, will be
scrutinised for compliance with regulations as
per the specifications of the model techno-legal
regime. In the case of major projects, these aspects
will be subjected to detailed technical evaluation
before granting construction permissions.
6.8 Techno-Financial Regime
The Guidelines issued by the NDMA will
form the basis for the formulation of plans for
mitigation projects at the national, state and
district levels. These mitigation projects will be
duly prioritised and approved by the NDMA. The
Planning Commission will include these DM plans
in the Five-Year and Annual Plans of the ministries
and departments of the GoI, as well as in the state
plans.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with the
TAC and in collaboration with central ministries;
state governments; the Planning Commission.]
After the occurrence of a disastrous landslide,
the centre and state governments provide funds
for immediate relief and rehabilitation. This process
does not adequately cover the requirements for
reconstruction of damaged structures and land,
especially those that are privately owned. The
expenditure incurred by the GoI in the provision of
funds for relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction is
increasing manifold due to the rapidly increasing
risk profile of the country. In most countries, risk
transfer through insurance has been adopted as
a step towards providing adequate compensation
for the loss of property caused by disasters. Such
Regulation And Enforcement
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
66
a mechanism reduces the financial burden on the
government. Risk transfer mechanisms have been
found to be fairly successful in some countries.
Therefore, the insurance sector will be encouraged
to promote such mechanisms in the future.
For this, the NDMA will develop a national risk
avoidance, risk sharing, and risk transfer strategy,
on the lines used for other disasters, using the
experiences of micro-level initiatives in some
states and global best practices, in consultation
with financial institutions, insurance companies,
and reinsurance agencies.
Financial institutions will consider the
compliance of safety aspects as far as slope
stability issues are concerned before offering
construction loans in hilly areas. The housing
development programmes supported by the
GoI and state governments (like the Indira Awas
Yojana), and all large-scale housing schemes
will be made to comply with the landslide safety
regime. The NDMA will assist MoM in coordinating
with the central ministries/departments concerned
and the concerned state governments for ensuring
compliance to this aspect by financial institutions.
The approval and disbursement of funds from
banks and other financial institutions to industrial
units will also be linked to compliance with slope
stability norms by these units.
6.9 Schedule for Regulation and
Enforcement
The schedule of activities for regulation
and enforcement is given in the table below. All
activities will be institutionalised and continue
beyond December 2010.
M*: Meetings
67
7.1 Awareness
Local communities that are aware about the
disastrous effects of landslide hazard and the
hazardous locales in their area would be in a better
position, both physically and psychologically,
to face its consequences. Since landslides are
frequent and sudden, and cause disasters that
affect localised areas resulting in segregated
losses, these do not receive appropriate attention
due to their transitory nature, and short-lived
human memory. Hence, the level of awareness
about landslides has been quite low compared
to other disasters like earthquakes, floods, and
cyclones. Cumulatively, losses due to landslides
are much higher in India than any other disaster
in hilly terrain. Thus, there is an immediate need
to educate people about landslides to reduce the
associated risk and losses.
State governments/SDMAs of landslide
affected areas, in collaboration with the nodal
agency and other key stakeholders, will make
special efforts to mobilise communities to
carry out landslide mitigation efforts. Electronic
and print media will also be associated in the
endeavour to create greater public awareness
about landslide hazard and importance of land use
zoning practices. Organisations and institutions
like the GSI, NIDM, IITs, CDDM, and other
knowledge-based institutions including some
NGOs will be entrusted with the responsibility
of preparing material for awareness generation
campaigns pertaining to the landslide prone states
in the country in a scheduled manner.
[Action: SDMAs/state governments; the MoMGSI; NIDM; CDMM; IITs, universities and other
7 Awareness and Preparedness
academic institutions; PTI; DAVP; Prasar Bharati;
private broadcasters.]
Comprehensive awareness campaigns
targeting different groups of people living
in landslide prone areas will be carried out
systematically. These campaigns will emphasise
the prevalent landslide risk and vulnerability
of the areas as well as highlight the roles and
responsibilities of communities and stakeholders
in addressing this risk. These will also focus on
the specific role that each institution/organisation
or community will play in order to mitigate the
effects of landslides.
[Action: SDMAs/state governments; the MoM-GSI
in collaboration with academic institutions and
the media.]
7.1.1 Creation of Public Awareness on
Landslide Risk Reduction
Handbooks, posters, and handbills containing
the status of landslide hazards will be distributed,
and details of landslide indicators along with
precautions to be adopted and suggestive
measures will be displayed near landslide prone
sites. All the above documents will be translated
into local and regional languages. Short video films
on landslide risk, vulnerability, and importance of
preparedness and mitigation measures will be
prepared for the general public. The electronic
and print media will also be made an integral part
of the campaigns.

depending on the results of earlier programmes.
Large construction companies and contractors
engaged in infrastructure development in hilly
regions in various parts of the country will undertake
campaigns to sensitise their members to the risk
and vulnerability resulting from landslides so that
necessary attention is paid to this hazard and
mitigation measures are included in design and
construction in vulnerable areas.
[Action: SDMAs/state governments; the MoMGSI; district administrations; NGOs.]
State governments/SDMAs, in collaboration
with the nodal agency, NGOs, and other identified
agencies, will organise awareness programmes
on the various aspects of landslide management
for specific target groups of stakeholders, elected
representatives, civil servants, members of local
authorities, school administrators, members of
Communities need to be alerted and made aware of:
i) What are the major disaster threat perceptions in the localities of immediate concern to them,
and what are the projected likely disaster scenarios (landslide included)?
ii) What are the possible landslide hazard distribution scenarios and major known landslide
spots and identified elements at risk in the area?
iii) What are the lessons to be learned from past landslide disasters in the area and from their
(mis)management?
iv) What are the precursors and early indicators that can avert a landslide disaster?
v) What are the elements like roads, housing, schools etc., exposed to landslide risk?
vi) What is the role and responsibility of the government and local bodies before, during and
after a disaster?
vii) What are the expected roles and responsibilities of communities and people at large—before,
during and after a disaster? How much responsibility are the residents and communities
willing to assume in choosing to live or do business in high risk areas?
viii) What are the roles of the public sector, corporate sector, NGOs and other voluntary organisations?
ix) Does the building material, design and construction conform to prevalent building codes and
established engineering practices?
7.1.2 Awareness Drives for Specific Target
Groups
One of the most challenging tasks in landslide
preparedness and mitigation is the sensitisation
of all the stakeholders, and educating and training
them to participate in landslide preparedness and
mitigation efforts. If the community recognises
the importance of landslide safety vis-à-vis
developmental activities, tremendous gains can
be achieved in landslide risk reduction.
The nodal agency along with state
governments, some selected institutions
collaborating with local bodies, urban planners,
and NGOs, will initiate programmes to sensitise
decision makers and other important functionaries
in undertaking mitigation measures in landslide
affected areas. The contents and structure of the
resource material will be reviewed and revised,
69
management boards of educational institutions
and hospitals, school children, representatives of
the corporate sector, the media, etc.
[Action: SDMAs/state governments; the MoMGSI; district administrations; NGOs.]
A comprehensive awareness campaign will
be developed and implemented for following safe
practices before, during, and after a landslide.
The campaign will also highlight the risks
and vulnerability of the states and the roles/
responsibilities of all the communities and
stakeholders in addressing the risk.
The GSI, the nodal agency, will maintain a list
of resource personnel and organisations capable
of conducting awareness generation campaigns,
which will be updated from time to time.
[Action: The MoM-GSI.]
Public awareness campaigns will be
conducted at the national, state, and district
centres and in high risk areas for disseminating
information on landslide risk management among
all stakeholders. Case studies documenting major
landslides will be prepared and used for creating
greater public awareness among professional and
critical stakeholders. Landslide risk management
will be done by applying available knowledge and
customising the same through R&D for specific
situations, and by generating new adaptive
techniques.
State governments/SDMAs and professional
bodies will organise knowledge and experience
sharing workshops for societal benefit. These
will also support private agencies to develop
their capacities to assess, predict, and monitor
landslides as well as implement appropriate
remedial measures.
[Action: SDMAs/state governments in collaboration
with the GSI.]
The NDRF will continue with its familiarisation
and community awareness programme on
response and relief in the landslide affected
regions. These efforts will be strengthened.
7.2 Landslide Preparedness
DM plans for landslide prone areas will be
systematically developed to prepare the stakeholders
in addressing landslide risk. These plans will be
region specific and will consider the risk profile and
special characteristics of a particular geographic
area. Preparedness will include the formulation of
family and community contingency plans.
Mock drills will be conducted in offices,
schools, industrial units, etc., and in the
neighbourhood of sites vulnerable to landslides.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with SDMAs; district
administrations.]
The employees of the GoI as well as major
private transport companies operating in
mountainous regions will be sensitised to the
landslide hazard of the area. They will be advised
to remain vigilant and respond effectively in
emergency situations.
7.2.1 Community Preparedness
Local authorities like gram panchayats, with the
help of NGOs and volunteer groups from within the
community will prepare and implement community
based DM plans. A database of these groups, their
contact details, and fields of specialisation will be
created and maintained at the district and state
levels. The state governments/SDMAs will set up
appropriate disaster management mechanisms to
act as links between the state government/SDMA
and different organisations.

The comprehensive exercise programme
followed by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) of the USA is a good example of
effective emergency preparedness. It includes
progressively complex exercises, each one
building on the previous one, until the exercises
are as close to reality as possible.
An exercise in the real sense is a focused
practice that puts the participants in a simulated
situation to function in the capacity that would be
expected of them in a real event. Its purpose is
to promote preparedness by testing policies and
plans and training personnel.
Exercises are conducted to evaluate an
organisation’s capability to execute one or more
portions of its response or contingency plans.
Many successful responses to emergencies over
the years have demonstrated that conducting
exercises pays huge dividends.
A comprehensive exercise programme
involves five main types of activities, viz.,
orientation seminar, drill, tabletop exercises,
functional exercises, and full-scale exercises.
Exercise programmes for each disaster prone
district will be developed and made an essential
part of the preparedness programme. The entire
cycle of an exercise programme from orientation
seminar to full scale exercise takes about 18 to
24 months. Complete exercises in disaster prone
districts will be conducted at least once in four
years after careful planning so that grey areas
in the preparedness programme are identified
and efforts are made to make the necessary
modifications. As per the specific situation,
these exercises will be conducted to assess
preparedness for all the hazards present in the
district rather than for individual hazards.
[Action: State governments/SDMAs.]
7.2.2 Medical Preparedness
The Disaster Management Plans (DMPs)
related to medical preparedness developed at
the state and district levels will be the same as
in other hazards. The principal aim of the medical
management plan will be to improve emergency
medical preparedness and response, which have
been dealt with in the Guidelines for Medical
Preparedness and Mass Casualty Management,
issued by the NDMA. In the case of landslide
hazard, medical preparedness will focus on
likely injuries resulting from landslides, including
psycho-social trauma. It will address the need for
surveillance, and for planning and rehearsing mock
exercises and drills for disaster preparedness.
Since the medical management plan will
include all existing disasters in the area, there is
a need to create greater awareness among all the
medical teams and the medical community at large
about the hazards and types of injuries that can
be inflicted, especially by landslides.
Medical First Responders (MFRs) for
administering first aid and resuscitation measures
at the incident site and during the transportation
of casualties, will be identified and trained. All
members of the medical and paramedical teams
will conduct regular exercises based on the
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) laid down
by the respective Disaster Management Authority
(DMAs) as part of their DM plans.
[Action: SDMAs in collaboration with the state
health and medical departments, and private
hospitals.]
All public health facilities will develop their
own DM plans, with arrangements for enhancing
their surge capacity in the event of disaster.
Training exercises and mock drills will be carried
out regularly by doctors and paramedical staff. The
medical preparedness plans will also include the
71
identification of trained trauma and psycho-social
care teams, with nursing and paramedical staff.
In high-risk landslide areas, mobile hospitals
and Quick Reaction Medical Teams (QRMTs) will
be developed as part of the overall disaster healthcare delivery system of the states to manage
patients with minor injuries at the incident site
itself.
[Action: SDMAs/DDMAs in collaboration with the
state health and medical departments and private
hospitals.]
7.3 Schedule for Awareness and
Preparedness Activities
Landslides, unlike other natural disasters,
occur as isolated incidents and hence have to
be treated individually. Therefore, awareness
campaigns, plans, timelines and schedules
will be developed separately and implemented
independently in accordance with the defined time
frame. However, in the case of preparedness, a
comprehensive plan that takes into consideration
all the disasters the area is prone to, needs to be
formulated and implemented.

8.1 Introduction
Capacity development efforts are an essential
part of the strategy to fight landslide disasters.
A realistic national capacity building programme,
commensurate with the intensity and extent of the
hazard in India will be evolved and implemented,
keeping in view the available resources. This
programme of resource enhancement will
encompass all institutions/organisations/
individuals that have a role in any part of the DM
cycle.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the MoM-GSI.]
Technicians, administrators, and rescue
workers who have been well trained and oriented
to act during emergency situations contribute
significantly in reducing the impact of disasters.
The target groups identified for capacity
development will include scientific and technical
institutions, elected representatives, government
officials, professionals in the electronic and print
media, town/urban planners in hilly regions,
infrastructure development companies, engineers,
architects, and builders, NGOs, private volunteers,
and other Community Based Organisations
(CBOs), social activists, social scientists, school
teachers, and school children.

8 Capacity Development
(Including Education, Training and Documentation)
Capacity development is a challenging
task that aims at preparing all the stakeholders
psychologically, socially, and technically to
participate in the management of landslide
disasters, and can be successful only if all the
stakeholders participate actively in this exercise,
which will include capacity upgradation, landslide
education, training, research and development,
and documentation.
India has a global presence in DM and the GoI
is a member of various international organisations
in the field of disaster response and relief.
It has linkages with foreign organisations like
the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs [UN (OCHA)], United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), and the United
Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination
(UNDAC) team. Efforts will be made to develop
these relations and utilise them in building
institutional and individual capacities in the field
of landslide disaster management as practised
elsewhere and also to participate in internationally
coordinated programmes in landslide research.
India will participate in the international effort
at improving the quality of preparedness and
response in liaison with international organisations.

and in collaboration with the MoM-GSI; MoES; DST.]
8.2 Landslide Education
Landslides are inevitable events, having been
a part of human history over the centuries. But
73
landslide incidence has increased alarmingly
due to extensive anthropogenic interference for
developmental activities in the once stable hilly
regions. The structures we build trigger landslides,
which in turn destroy these structures.
We must learn to understand that humans
become victims of nature’s fury when the natural
equilibrium is disturbed. There are several
causative factors, other than anthropogenic
interference, that give rise to slope instability.
Looking at a landslide, experienced eyes can
visualise to some extent the causative factors
leading to slope distress. We need to educate
professionals involved in landslide management
so that the gap between theory and practice is
bridged. Anthropogenic factors fuel landslides and
that should be made clear to architects, planners,
engineers, and builders, especially in landslide
prone areas. Educating decision makers, local
authorities, NGOs, communities, the media, and
other stakeholders is as important.
The affected state governments will make
sincere efforts to strengthen the field of natural
disaster education in general, and landslide
education in particular, by incorporating the best
available technical and non-technical inputs on
landslide safety in educational curricula at the
secondary and senior secondary levels in all
schools. Landslide education will address the
multifaceted aspects of landslide management,
especially preparedness, mitigation, and response
efforts. In this regard, case histories of past
disastrous landslides will be used as valuable
inputs for disaster education in general, and
landslide education in particular.
[Action: The SDMAs/state governments; the
MHRD.]
Disaster related curricula have already been
introduced in class VIII, IX and X levels in CBSE
schools. The education boards of states with
hilly terrains will develop similar content in their
curricula.
The state governments/SDMAs, in collaboration
with their respective boards of secondary education,
will ensure that the subject of disaster safety and
disaster preparedness is introduced at the senior
secondary level (Class XI and XII) and at the
undergraduate level in technical and non-technical
disciplines as well, and that landslides form an
integral part of disaster education.
[Action: SDMAs/state governments; the MHRD.]
The development of high-quality educational
material, textbooks, field training, and a high
standard of teaching at all levels will be given due
emphasis. Education and training programmes
will be designed with greater focus on the
development of the capacity and skills of trainers
and teachers. Science and technology courses
designed by experts and designated institutions
will be introduced to orient all target groups,
including school teachers, NGOs, private
volunteers, and other professionals engaged in
disaster management.
The central and state governments will
encourage knowledge institutions to undertake
research, teaching, and training, which will further
contribute to improving landslide education in
India.
[Action: Central ministries in collaboration with
NDMA; SDMAs/state governments.]
8.2.1 Education of Professionals
It is time for knowledge institutions and
universities to give focused attention to landslide
education through the revision of syllabi, enlarging
the scope of teaching earth sciences and allied
disciplines with a practical bias, and through the
crafting of new educational programmes. The
Capacity Development (Including Education, Training And Documentation)
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
74
curricula in earth sciences, engineering geology,
seismology, geotechnical engineering, structural
engineering, and architectural aspects needs
special attention. It would help to learn from
the MHRD’s National Programme in Earthquake
Engineering Education (NPEEE). Another area
requiring intervention is the training of professional
engineers and architects to ensure that classroom
teaching benefits professional practice. A large
number of professionals require training and
retraining. The endeavour will be to prioritise
the enhancement of the quality of teaching, text
books, training kits, etc., in the field of landslide
education.
We need to create a breed of professionals
who will appreciate the importance of correct
diagnosis before slope treatment. Engineering
geologists will have to discuss the microgeological details controlling a landslide, and not
just stop at a broad description of the lithology.
A geotechnical engineer needs education to
realise that orthodox soil mechanics has long
been replaced by modern soil mechanics, with
concepts, tools and techniques that can help
characterise and analyse a landslide more reliably.
Landslide managers need the education that will
make them insist on a scientific, systematic slope
investigation, realising that ad hoc measures
without sound investigation may prove to be a
costly waste.
Self-education programmes by the effective
use of multi-media based knowledge products
need to be encouraged and prioritised. This will
accordingly be taken up for implementation.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the NIDM;
University Grants Commission (UGC); Prasar
Bharati; private broadcasters; IITs, universities,
and other academic institutions.]
We need to educate our professionals in
damage and loss assessment due to landslides
and create simple tools and uniform procedures
by which objective assessment becomes possible.
Technical institutes, polytechnics, and
universities located in vulnerable areas will develop
adequate technical expertise on the various
subjects related to landslide management. The
state governments, if required, in association with
the UGC, DST, MHRD, AICTE, etc., will introduce
short-term Quality Improvement Programmes
(QIPs) for teachers and professionals engaged in
teaching subjects related to landslides. The new
technical programmes, similar to those launched
by various central ministries for college teachers,
geoscientists, civil engineers, town planners, etc.,
for developing additional capacities in landslide
management will also be taken up. The GoI will
have to address the gap between the requirement
and availability of qualified teachers conversant
with natural hazards, especially with landslide
assessment and mitigation techniques. All such
training programmes will include evaluation and
certification of trainees.
[Action: SDMAs/state DGMs; state governments;
the MHRD; IITs, universities, and other academic
institutions.]
The subject of disaster medicine covers trauma
care, epidemic control, emergency medical care by
paramedics and emergency medical technicians,
telemedicine, etc. DM related medical education
will receive due attention at the undergraduate
level, so that graduating doctors are able to handle
emergencies with greater confidence.
The NDMA in consultation with the Ministry
of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW), Medical
Council of India (MCI) and other related agencies,
will facilitate the introduction of subjects related
to DM in the undergraduate medical curriculum.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the MHRD;
MoH&FW; MCI.]
75
All architecture and civil engineering graduates
will be taught in detail about all the aspects
of landslides and related hazards in the hilly
regions of India. These educational efforts will
aim to improve the knowledge and skills of
human resources by reviewing and updating the
curricula periodically, upgrading the facilities, and
institutionalising the desired capacity building
mechanisms in mitigating this hazard. The
mainstreaming of landslide management in
development planning will be supplemented with
the development of the requisite infrastructure
in technical and professional institutions, and
improved laboratories and libraries in identified
R&D institutions. These measures will enable
these institutions to undertake research and
execute pilot projects on the different aspects
of landslides employing the latest technology,
and to set pace setter examples that will build
confidence amongst geoscientists, geo-technical
engineers, and communities, with regard to
landslide management. The results of these
studies will also help to develop and update
technical documents that will form an important
part of the resource material prepared for training
programmes on education, sensitisation, and
training. The disaster management plans of the
central ministries and departments concerned
and the state governments will address these
requirements in right earnest.
[Action: The AICTE in collaboration with IITs,
universities and other academic institutions; the
CoA.]
The curricula of IITs, National Institutes of
Technology (NITs), engineering and architecture
colleges, polytechnics, and universities will be
suitably modified to incorporate basic knowledge
about landslides and the techniques employed
to control them. The NDMA along with the nodal
agency will facilitate this process in collaboration
with the MHRD, AICTE, CoA, and professional
bodies of town planners to incorporate landslide
education in their curricula.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with IITs, universities,
and other academic institutions; the MoM-GSI;
MHRD; AICTE; CoA.]
8.2.2 Community Education
The need for community education cannot be
over-emphasised since the community is usually
the first responder to a disaster and its role in
containing damage is of prime significance. It is
necessary that the government and communities
involved, evolve a joint action plan together,
aiming at spreading community awareness
and developing community leadership. Such
awareness will enable communities to ensure
safer constructions.
Investments in disaster education, public
awareness, community leadership development,
and disaster education of unemployed youth,
physically challenged, elderly, women, and school
children will be encouraged.
[Action: The SDMAs in collaboration with the
DDMAs; NGOs.]
8.3 Training
The NDMA and the nodal agency, viz., the GSI
along with other knowledge institutions, with a
view to popularising landslide education and giving
momentum to research activities in India, will
identify a number of leading technical institutes
and earth science departments of universities
which support such activities. Such institutions
will also offer the services of experienced faculty
members to participate in the activities specified
in the Guidelines.

76
The GSI and NIDM with the help of other
knowledge based national institutions and the
states’ Administrative Training Institutes (ATIs)
have been identified and entrusted with the
responsibility of training administrative personnel
from all central ministries and departments and
state governments on the different aspects
of landslides. As per the requirements, these
organisations will evolve an action plan jointly in
collaboration with the ATIs and other technical
institutions to offer a comprehensive curriculum
on landslide management in the form of training
modules for the various target groups. The design,
development, and delivery of the same will be
initiated by October 2008.
The DGMs in landslide affected states have
a significant number of geoscientists. Many of
these will be involved in landslide hazard mitigation
programmes and studies after proper training.
[Action: The SDMAs in collaboration with state
DGMs.]
A large number of diploma holders are involved
in construction activities at civil engineering and
infrastructural project sites in landslide affected
areas. Such training programmes will be offered to
these professionals as well. The training modules
will include both classroom and on-field training.
The state governments will also evolve a formal
framework for the certification of such professionals
and adopt certification practices through short-term
courses. Certification through online short-term
courses and self-certification aids like CD-ROMs
developed on similar lines as those developed by
the CDMM can also be considered.
[Action: State governments in collaboration with
the SDMAs.]
8.3.1 Training of Professionals
Geologists, geotechnical engineers, and
professionals from other disciplines involved in
landslide hazard investigation and management
need to be kept updated with the latest global
developments in this field, so that a welltrained workforce conversant with the latest
technological advances is available to manage
the hazard effectively. This can be done by
sending these professionals abroad regularly to
gain theoretical knowledge as well as practical
experience on the application of the latest
and most effective techniques. The training
programmes will be systematically planned
and executed, with extensive interdisciplinary
exposure for generating a workforce trained in
holistic landslide management.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the NIDM;
MoM-GSI; IITs, universities, and other academic
institutions.]
The GSI and NIDM in consultation with
reputed knowledge institutions will develop
comprehensive programmes for creating
trainers from among trained faculty members
of engineering and architecture colleges, and
other professionals. The state governments/
SDMAs will identify potential trainers to develop
training programmes at different levels. These
training programmes will be pilot tested, critically
evaluated, upgraded, documented, and peer
reviewed at regular intervals. The training modules
will be continuously updated based on evaluation
and feedback from the participants.
[Action: The MoM-GSI in collaboration with the
NIDM; IITs, universities, and other academic
institutions; SDMAs; AICTE; CoA.]
In the initial phases, training will be imparted
to all officers of landslide affected states,
like engineers, geologists, geophysicists,
and hydrologists from the DGMs and other
departments involved in developmental activities
in hilly regions, especially in the ULBs and PRIs
of such states.
77
In particular, the design directorates in the
state departments, if any, will ensure that they
have architects and engineers with a background
in landslide-safe design and construction. Those
who have undergone the ‘Training of Trainers’
programme will be responsible for training
professionals through the network of professional
societies. A timetable will be drawn up for these
training programmes to give architects and
engineers the opportunity to upgrade their skills
in the required areas. The minimum acceptable
standards of safety, as enumerated in the BIS
codes, will be disseminated through professional
organisations, and the training requirements will
be integrated into the licensing criteria.
Landslide disaster management related
search and rescue operations involve certain
specialised activities and require expertise in areas
like mountaineering, rock climbing, heli-slithering,
heli-rescue, and trained dog squad capabilities.
Specialised training modules for these will be
developed by the NDRF in collaboration with
national and international organisations working in
this field. All NDRF battalions in landslide affected
regions will be trained in these modules.
[Action: State governments in collaboration with
the SDMAs; DDMAs; state DGMs.]
8.4 Capacity Upgradation
A mechanism will be developed to identify
institutions active in the field of landslides, assess
their capabilities, and enhance and strengthen
Areas where Training is Required
i) Geomorphological, geotechnical, hydro-geological and GIS based LHM with perception of
mapping scales.
ii) Geotechnical investigation of landslides with particular reference to the characterisation of
slopes, elucidation of landslide boundaries, representative undisturbed sampling from shear
zones, handling of samples, simulated stress-path testing and stability analysis in terms of
total and effective stresses.
iii) Techniques for monitoring slope surface and sub-slope movements, movement rates, and
cross-linkage with rainfall records, piezometric profiles, and behaviour of buildings and
structures on the slope.
iv) Slope modelling.
v) GIS based landslide hazard, vulnerability, and risk assessments.
vi) Slope kinetics, site effects, and earthquake induced landslides in seismic micro-zonation and
risk assessment.
vii) Instrumentation of slopes, landslides, and avalanches, and early warning.
viii) Design of landslides and avalanche control measures with particular reference to the choice
of technologies.
ix) Training of first responders in search, rescue and medical care.
x) Training of communities and local bodies.
xi) Training of visual, print and electronic media in the science of disaster management for
improved and more objective reporting.

78
their capacities in terms of expertise, knowledge,
and resources for the effective management
of landslide hazards. The main areas requiring
capacity development in the context of landslide
disaster management are as follows:
i) The establishment of a nation-wide,
organised, vibrant, pro-active, systematic,
and scientific institutional mechanism that
will replace the current piecemeal, ad hoc,
and poorly recognised and appreciated
landslide management practices.
ii) The enhancement of expertise and
capacities of knowledge centres in different
parts of the country for dependable and
timely geomorphological, geotechnical,
and hydro-geological investigations; and for
scientific design, and speedy and effective
implementation of control measures.
iii) The strengthening of a few identified
institutions, their units and departments
in all states and union territories. If
possible, their respective mandates/roles
in providing/supporting pre- and postlandslide routine/specialised functions are
to be redefined and enlarged.
[Action: The TAC in collaboration with the MoM-GSI.]
8.5 Documentation
The NDMA and GSI will facilitate the preparation
of films, manuals, and other material targeting
various stakeholders to inculcate landslide
safety by following land zoning regulations.
State governments will provide landslide safety
material in multiple formats and languages, so
that different groups of stakeholders can have
the requisite information. The NDMA, GSI,
NIDM and state governments/SDMAs will set up
websites and portals to disseminate information
related to landslide safety. This information will
include specific details on the landslide risk and
vulnerability of the states, landslide management
basics, and landslide risk mitigation for the safety
of the natural and built environment.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the MoM-GSI;
NIDM; SDMAs; DAVP; NGOs; IITs, universities,
and other academic institutions.]
The state governments will assist specialists in
the subject from academia and industry to prepare
technical documents on landslides, which will
provide technical specifications for the expansion
of human settlements in hilly areas, and simple
techniques for assessing landslide hazards in other
areas. National and regional libraries and information
centres will be encouraged to build repositories
of technical resources (books, reports, journals,
electronic documents, etc.) related to landslides.
[Action: The SDMAs in collaboration with the CoA;
IITs, universities, and other academic institutions.]
The implementation of these Guidelines
requires the participation of a wide spectrum of
professionals.
The GSI and other knowledge institutions like
the NIDM, IITs, NITs, and other professional bodies
will generate and maintain a directory of landslide
management professionals in India, containing
their brief bio-data, and make this available to the
state governments/SDMAs.
[Action: The MoM-GSI in collaboration with the
NIDM; CBRI; CRRI; IITs, universities, and other
academic institutions.]
The GSI along with other institutions will
undertake the task of documenting the history
of landslide studies and other related activities
in India. A number of documents on landslide
investigations that have been prepared in the past
have now become difficult to access or are out
of print. The GSI will launch a special initiative to
digitise these documents from various sources
and archive them in electronic format in the
data bank proposed for this purpose, giving due
recognition to the source. The NDMA will help the
GSI in obtaining these rare documents from the
available sources.

9 Response
9.1 Introduction
The management and control of the adverse
consequences of future landslide incidence
will require coordinated, prompt, and effective
response systems at the central and state
government levels, and especially at the district
and the community levels in the landslide
affected areas. Since many components of the
response initiatives are the same for different
types of disasters, systems need to be developed
considering the multi-hazard scenario of various
regions in order to optimally utilise the available
resources.
Depending on the magnitude of the
landslide and scale of the required response, the
corresponding role players will be identified and
mobilised at the district, state or national levels.
Systems will be institutionalised by the
DMAs at various levels for coordination between
different agencies like central government
ministries and departments, state governments,
district administrations, ULBs, PRIs, and other
stakeholders for an effective post-landslide
response.
[Action: Central ministries in collaboration with
state governments/SDMAs; DDMAs; ULBs, PRIs]
Since some earthquakes trigger landslides, the
IMD will immediately communicate the occurrence
of an earthquake along with preliminary details
to the SDMAs and GSI for initial assessment of
earthquake induced landslides and dissemination
of the appropriate alerts.
[Action: The IMD in collaboration with the SDMAs;
MoM-GSI; NRSC.]
The preliminary assessment of the severity
of the landslide is based on its magnitude and
the amount of loss it inflicts on infrastructural
elements and habitations.
Agencies like the BRO/state PWDs, state
DGMs, forest departments, municipal/panchayat
bodies will immediately communicate information
on the occurrence of a landslide along with
preliminary details like its location, magnitude,
damage caused, etc., to the district emergency
centre or district disaster management control
room. These designated bodies will communicate
this information to the state disaster management
commissioner for onward transmission to primary
nodes like the nodal agency, viz., the GSI and
other nodes like the MHA and NRSC identified
for this disaster. This will help the nodal agency,
other central government departments, and state
governments to undertake field observations for
making an accurate assessment and planning
follow-up action.
[Action: State governments in collaboration with state
DGMs; BRO; MoEF; DoS-NRSC; DDMAs; State
Resource Centres; NDRF; MoM-GSI; MHA; PRIs.]
The DM plans prepared by all the agencies
concerned will incorporate detailed guidelines
for their activities related to the impact of the
landslide. The response component of the DM
plans will consider the rapid deployment of
the designated people, supplies, and logistics
to the disaster site, with the functions of each
81
functionary clearly defined. Each of the teams
will be required to vacate the site as soon as their
job is over because considering the nature of the
hazard during the rainy season it is possible that
they may be required at another site within a short
duration. These plans will prescribe appropriate
coordination mechanisms among all the agencies
working in the affected areas.
9.2 Emergency Search and Rescue
The community in the affected neighbourhood
is always the first responder after any disaster.
Experience has shown that initially over 80 per cent
of search and rescue operations are carried out
by local communities before the state machinery
and specialised search and rescue teams arrive.
Trained and equipped teams consisting of
local people will be set up in landslide prone
areas to respond effectively in the event of a
disaster.
[Action: DDMAs in collaboration with PRIs.]
Community level teams will be developed
in each district with basic training in search and
rescue. Training modules will be developed for
trainers of community level search and rescue
teams by district authorities with the help of the
NDRF training institutes.
[Action: SDMAs in collaboration with the NDRF;
PRIs; district administrations.]
The workforce employed by the organisations
engaged in maintaining roads and highways
located in hilly regions will also be trained in initial
search and rescue operations and equipped with
modern search and rescue equipment. On the
ground, if required, the NDRF battalions will also
assist the state government/district authorities
in training communities, for which they will be
sensitised. They will be further assisted by the civil
defence, home guards, fire services, and NGOs.
State governments will develop procedures for
formally recognising and certifying such trained
search and rescue team members. They will also
provide suitable indemnity to community level
team members for their actions in the course
of emergency response following a landslide
disaster.
Youth organisations such as the National
Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme
(NSS), and Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS)
will provide support services to the response
teams at the local level under the overall guidance
and supervision of the local administration.
[Action: SDMAs in collaboration with the NCC;
NSS; NYKS.]
9.3 Emergency Relief
Trained community level teams will assist
in planning and setting up emergency shelters,
providing relief to the affected people, identifying
missing people, and addressing the needs of
emergency medical care, water supply and
sanitation, food and temporary shelter, etc., of the
affected community.
These teams will also establish communication
with the district authorities for arranging the
evacuation of stranded people, particularly for
vulnerable sections. Members of these teams will
be made aware of the specific requirements of
the disaster affected communities. These teams
will also assist the government in identifying the
most vulnerable people who may need special
assistance when stranded following a large
landslide on a highway, etc.

9.4 Incident Command System
All response activities will be undertaken at
the local level through a suitably devised Incident
Command System (ICS) and coordinated by
the local administration through an Emergency
Operations Centre (EOC). State governments will
commission and maintain EOCs at appropriate
levels for the coordination of human resources,
relief supplies, and equipment.
[Action: State governments/SDMAs; district
administrations; PRIs.]
SOPs for the EOCs will be developed by
state governments and integrated within the
framework of the ICS, which will take advantage
of modern technologies and tools, such as GIS
maps, scenarios, and simulation models for
effectively responding to disasters. GIS maps
available with other sources, such as the district
and municipal planning departments, will be
compiled considering their potential application
after a disaster. The state governments/SDMAs
will undertake the training of personnel involved
in the ICS. Any unusual occurrence should be
immediately reported by the community to the
authorities, so that its cognisance is taken care of.
[Action: State governments/SDMAs.]
9.5 Community Based Disaster
Response
The DDMAs will coordinate with organisations
like NGOs, voluntary agencies, self-help groups,
youth organisations, women’s groups, civil
defence, home guards, and the community at
large that normally volunteer their services in postdisaster situations.
The state government/SDMAs will utilise and
allocate these human resources for performing
various response activities as per their capabilities.
State governments will interact with these
agencies to understand and plan their roles in the
command chain of the ICS and incorporate them
in the DM plans.
[Action: DDMAs in collaboration with the home
guards; NGOs; NYKS.]
Natural disasters of large magnitude draw
overwhelming humanitarian support from
individuals and organisations. The relief and
response activities carried out by such organisations
will be coordinated and shall comply with the
norms prescribed by the appropriate authorities.
After a disastrous landslide incidence,
accurate information will be provided on the
extent of the losses and details of the response
activities through the electronic and print media.
State governments will utilise different types of
media, especially print, radio, television, internet,
and SMS to disseminate timely and accurate
information.
9.6 Role of Private and Corporate
Sectors
The state governments will facilitate the
involvement of the corporate and private sector
and utilise their services and resources if offered
to the government during the immediate postdisaster situation. The India Disaster Resource
Network (IDRN) will be maintained and updated
regularly so that locally available resources are
utilised effectively in the case of emergencies.
The corporate sector, as a part of the Corporate
Social Responsibility (CSR) effort, can provide,
inter alia, the services of hospitals, power and
telecommunication, relief supplies, search and
rescue equipment, earthmoving equipment, and
transport and logistics for the movement of relief
supplies. For instance, the Construction Federation
of India (CFI) has set up the IDRN, which lists
83
equipment and resources by type and the function
performed, along with contact addresses of the
controlling officers. The IDRN is a live system and
is updated every quarter at both the district and
state levels. These can be mobilised promptly at
the time of emergency as part of the response.
The state governments and district authorities will
develop appropriate mechanisms to receive and
optimally utilise all such assistance.
[Action: SDMAs.]
9.7 Specialised Teams for Response
The Central Government has set up eight
NDRF battalions for providing rapid response
to disasters. All 144 teams of the NDRF will
be specially equipped and trained in landslide,
avalanche and collapsed structure search and
rescue operations. The NDRF battalions will also
be provided with communication equipment
like satellite phones for establishing continuous
connectivity in every part of the country where
landslides or other disasters can occur.
[Action: The NDRF.]
The fire services in the ULBs of various states
are being used as an emergency-cum-fire services
force. The fire services will be trained adequately
so that they can respond to different disasters
promptly, in addition to managing fires.
The police play a very important role after a
disaster by maintaining law and order, assisting in
search and rescue, and in the transportation and
certification of casualties. In case the landslide
causes traffic disruptions for a long duration,
the traffic police will play an important role by
regulating and controlling the flow of traffic
movement.
The home guards serve as an auxiliary arm
of the police force and support the district
administration in various tasks. The civil defence
is being reoriented to assist in handling DM.
Members of these organisations will be trained
in tasks like search, rescue and evacuation,
protection of assets in evacuated areas, and
management of relief camps and aid distribution
centres.
To augment the capacities of the states,
all state governments will raise from within
their armed police force, an adequate strength
of personnel for the State Disaster Response
Force (SDRF) capable of responding to disaster
situations. In addition, the police, fire services,
home guards and civil defence need to be
strengthened and upgraded to have adequate
capacity to respond effectively to disasters.
[Action: State governments/SDMAs.]
The training and implementation of emergency
response will be planned keeping in view the fact
that the type of rescue operation varies with the
nature of the landslide.
Snow avalanche search and rescue is a
specialised technique involving probes, avalanche
transceivers, trained avalanche dogs, etc. This
also includes emergency on the spot first aid.
Institutionalisation of avalanche search and rescue
operations will be collaborative work involving the
local administration, NDMA, and mountaineering
institutes in the country. Local communities and
NDRF personnel will be trained for search and
rescue operations.
9.7.1 Civil Defence
In any disaster, the affected community has a
major role to play, both as victim and necessarily
as the first responder, as outside help only
comes later. Having realised the significance of
this, the GoI has already decided to revamp the
civil defence set-up in the country. Civil defence,
Response
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
84
which was set up in the context of war to cover
only important towns (225 in number), will now
be utilised for disaster management as well. Each
district of the country will now have a civil defence
set-up which will cover the entire district. There will
be about 18 persons employed on a full-time basis
in each district, out of which eight will be trainers
entrusted with the duty of training volunteers and
wardens for response in DM.
Though the amendment of the Civil Defence
Act to include DM in its charter of duties is in
process, the GoI has already included this duty
through an executive order.
All the revamping proposals will be
implemented in a phased manner. In the first
phase (year 2008-09) 40 major civil defence towns
have been identified which will now cover entire
districts concerned. Equipment for training and
response has already been decided on and is in
the process of being procured and distributed to
the concerned 40 towns/districts. Till such time as
the revamping takes final shape, the states should
start using the existing set-up for recruiting and
training more volunteers in large numbers and
spreading awareness on the different aspects of
DM. The NDMA is also in the process of preparing
a comprehensive curriculum for civil defence
training at different levels in DM. This curriculum
will be circulated by the end of January 2009.
The state governments/SDMAs and DDMAs
will coordinate the human resources of the civil
defence set-up as well as those of other agencies
for performing/responding to various disaster
related activities.
[Action: State governments/SDMAs; DDMAs.]
9.7.2 Trigger Based Categorisation
The MHA in consultation with the nodal agency
has developed a colour coded categorisation of
landslide stages for triggering appropriate alerts
within the government machinery. Three colour
coded stages (red, orange, and yellow) were
defined on the basis of dimension, location,
and damages caused by the landslide. The
nodal agency and other knowledge institutions
in coordination with the state governments
will take up the geotechnical investigation
of landslides falling within the high alert red
category stage and suggest appropriate remedial
measures. Landslides in this category are of
large dimensions that have occurred at or in
the close vicinity of urban settlements or fairly
large rural settlements, inflicting heavy loss of
human life and/or urban infrastructure. This also
includes landslides that block busy pilgrimage
routes during the peak season, resulting in
hardship to thousands of pilgrims, and landslides
which result in blocking courses of relatively
large natural drainages with or without the
formation of landslide dams. Landslides of small
or moderate dimension located at the fringes
or away from human habitation and causing
limited loss/damage are categorised under the
medium and low alert, viz., yellow and orange
categories, respectively. The management of
these shall be taken up by the district and state
administrations. The GSI and other knowledge
based organisations will provide assistance to
state governments, and train professionals on a
need basis for geotechnical studies and remedial
measures. However, the details of all landslide
occurrences have to be communicated to the
nodal agency for the maintenance of a national
database.
9.8 Emergency Logistics
Specialised heavy earthmoving and search and
rescue equipment are required immediately after
a landslide to clear debris and carry out search
and rescue operations of trapped people in huge
masses of debris.
85
State governments will compile a list of such
equipment, identify their suppliers, and enter into
long-term agreements for their mobilisation and
deployment in the event of a landslide disaster.
The IDRN, which is a web based inventory
of information on emergency equipment and
response personnel available in every district, will
be revised and updated every three months. A
mechanism for deploying the required equipment
at very short notice in case of the occurrence of a
disastrous landslide will be in place.
[Action: State governments/SDMAs.]
The provision of temporary shelters and basic
amenities for stranded travellers would require
pre-planning. The DM plans at the state and district
levels will address this issue in detail. It is also
being considered that semi-permanent shelters
with basic amenities be established at certain
critical locations that are affected by landslides
that frequently result in people getting stranded
for long periods.
[Action: SDMAs in collaboration with the DDMAs.]
In the event of a large number of casualties,
the respective states will develop systems for the
proper identification of the deceased, recording
the details of victims and handing over bodies to
their kin as quickly as possible.
9.8.1 Emergency Medical Response
Whenever required, a prompt and efficient
emergency medical response will be provided by
QRMTs, mobile field hospitals, Accident Relief
Medical Vans (ARMVs) and heli-ambulances that
are in place for other disasters like earthquakes.
They will be activated to reach the landslide
affected locations immediately, along with dressing
material, splints, portable X-ray machines, mobile
operation theatres, resuscitation equipment and lifesaving drugs, etc. Resuscitation, triage and medical
evacuation of victims who require hospitalisation will
be done in accordance with the SOPs.
[Action: SDMAs in collaboration with the state
medical and health departments and private
hospitals.]
The emergency medical plan will be
operationalised immediately on receiving
information from a landslide affected location.
Hospitals will create capacity for the anticipated
number of beds by discharging non-critical
patients, and mobilising doctors and support staff,
additional orthopaedic equipment and supplies at
short notice in landslide affected areas, during the
rainy season when the majority of landslides occur.
After the occurrence of a disastrous landslide, an
information centre will be set up for disseminating
accurate information to public, relatives of victims,
and the media at the district level in case the
number of casualties is high.
The medical response to disaster situations
has been delineated in detail in the National
Disaster Management Guidelines: Medical
Preparedness and Mass Causality Management,
section 5.1, p. 49.
9.9 Damage and Loss Assessment
It is very important to assess the losses
resulting from a landslide as this is an important
factor in deciding whether it is economical to
treat it or not. Landslide-loss data are generally
categorised as either direct or indirect. Losses can
occur in a geographic region collectively (many,
possibly intermingled, landslides that may affect
lifelines and public safety, as well as individual
buildings) or as a single, isolated event that affects
a small geographic area, such as a highway or
residential structures.
Response
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
86
Direct costs include the repair, replacement, or
maintenance resulting from damage to property or
installations within the boundaries of the landslide
or from flooding caused by the breach of a natural
dam formed due to the obstruction of natural
drainage due to landsliding.
Some examples of indirect landslide losses
are:
i) The loss of industrial, agricultural, and
forest productivity; and tourist revenues
as a result of damage to land or facilities,
or interruption of transportation systems.
ii) Reduced real estate values in areas
threatened by landslides.
iii) The loss of tax revenues on properties
devalued as the result of landslides.
iv) Measures that are required to be taken
to prevent or mitigate additional landslide
damage.
v) Adverse effects on water quality in streams
and irrigation facilities outside the landslide
area.
vi) The loss of human or animal productivity
because of injury, death, or psychological
trauma.
vii) Secondary physical effects, such as
landslide-caused flooding, for which losses
are both direct and indirect.
Indirect costs may exceed direct costs.
Unfortunately, most indirect costs are difficult
to evaluate and thus often ignored or when
estimated, are too conservative. More often,
however, as financial information is often of a
discreet nature and in many instances, not in the
public domain, people and entities prefer to keep
their losses a private matter.
Currently, damage assessment in the case of
natural disasters in many countries is done using
aerial photography, videography, and ground
checks. This is not regular practice in India. With
the recent advances made in remote sensing
technology, it has become possible to use it
effectively even for the assessment of damages
resulting from landslides. In order to be able to
use EO data for landslide damage assessment,
the following criteria must be fulfilled:
i) High temporal and high spatial resolution
products should be made available.
ii) Images should be taken at the time of
the disaster or a few days after the event.
These can support relief efforts effectively.
This will be satisfied partly by existing and
planned high resolution stereo optical and SAR
systems. In cases where the damage is extensive,
either by a single large event or by many smaller
events spread over a large area, there is a need
for very high resolution images before and after
the disaster. These can be used to supplement the
data obtained from airborne and ground exercises.
9.10 Schedules for Response Activities

workforce mobilisation. The schedule for the same

10 Research and Development
10.1 Introduction
Research and development in the field of
landslides has attracted very little attention in India,
while the same is gaining momentum globally.
Intense R&D activities are required to be taken up
by institutions and individual experts in order to
achieve the goal of effective LHM in the country.
Central ministries, state governments, and
funding agencies will encourage, promote,
and support R&D activities to address current
challenges, offer solutions, and develop new
investigation techniques, with the application
of the latest developments in remote
sensing, communications, and instrumentation
technologies.
[Action: SDMAs in collaboration with the MoES;
MoM-GSI; DST; DoS-NRSC; central ministries;
state governments.]
These R&D activities will also strive for the
development of new cost-effective treatment
measures required to stabilise unstable slopes and
the development of economical and effective early
warning systems wherever necessary. Education
in landslide management will be meaningful
only if the students are exposed to the latest
technological developments and are made aware
of local landslide problems and the lessons learnt
from past experiences.
The nodal agency and respective state
governments will constitute multi-institutional
and multi-disciplinary teams for carrying out postlandslide field investigations to assess the hazard
potential and estimate the risk involved. They will
also document the lessons and disseminate the
same to target audiences within the state and
recommend cost effective practical measures. The
nodal agency will oversee the progress of these
efforts in a systematic manner.
[Action: The MoM-GSI in collaboration with the
SDMAs; state governments; DST; CBRI; CRRI;
IITs, universities, and other academic institutions.]
10.2 Research Issues
There are a number of important areas of
research which need to be addressed that will
lead to the standardisation of investigating and
operating procedures, more reliable LHZ mapping,
vulnerability assessment and risk analysis, cost
effective landslide stabilisation, user friendly
multi-hazard mapping, damage assessment, and
the introduction of state-of-the-art technology. A
considerable amount of R&D work is needed to
develop a basic understanding of various types
of landslides in India, their causative factors, and
mechanisms of development, with particular
reference to anthropogenic factors.
10.2.1 Standardisation
Some institutes and organisations carry out
both LHZ mapping and site specific studies of
landslides. However, there is no uniformity in
the methodology, selection of the scale of LHZ
mapping and usage of landslide terminology.
As a result, a lot of confusion is created
among geoscientists. Standardisation of the
terminology and classification of landslides,
thematic mapping scales and the introduction of
mapping methodologies for different scales will
89
be accorded priority. Scientific and systematic
approaches for the site specific study of landslides
and procedures of ground validation of LHZ maps
are equally important, as is the development of
scientific approaches to integrating the landslide
hazard into multi-hazard mapping.
R&D activities will be intensified to standardise
the terminology and classification of landslides,
thematic mapping scales, and to develop uniform
methodologies for different scales. Scientific
and systematic approaches for site specific
study of landslides, and procedures for the
ground validation of LHZ maps will be prepared
immediately.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with the
TAC and in collaboration with BIS; IITs, universities,
and other academic institutions.]
A research programme will be undertaken by
knowledge based organisations/institutes of India
for developing a scientific approach of integrating
the landslide hazard into multi-hazard mapping.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with DST; IITs,
universities, and other academic institutions.]
10.2.2 Earthquake-Induced Landslides
An improved understanding of earthquakeinduced landslides will call for research on
the estimation of site effects in different
geomorphological settings. Research to
enhance the understanding of the reactivation
of old and recent landslides and initiation of
first time earthquake-triggered landslides will
be encouraged. Other topics of research may
include run-out effects of flow slides resulting
from earthquake liquefaction.
A research programme will be developed so that
this aspect of landslide investigation is understood
and appropriate remedial measures may be
undertaken before an earthquake strikes. Knowledge
based institutes, like IIT-R, IIT Kanpur (IIT-K), etc., will
be encouraged to take up such programmes.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the DST; IITs,
universities, and other academic institutions.]
10.2.3 Design of Surface and Sub-Surface
Drainage Systems
In India the rainwater from the landslide
surface is generally drained out through surface
drainage systems comprising lined catch water
drains, contour drains, and chute drains (often of
the cascading type). In the absence of any data
about the catchment characteristics of a particular
slope, the design of these drains is generally
done on the basis of the expert’s knowledge. On
the other hand, sub-surface water management
of the landslide mass or distressed hill slope is
rarely practiced in our country. As a result, some
of the slides requiring only sub-surface drainage
arrangement for stabilisation are provided with
other makeshift remedial measures, triggering
the landslide instead of containing it. Moreover,
there is no systematic approach or established
mechanism to test the efficacy of the implemented
surface drainage measures.
Efforts will be directed towards R&D in
scientific and innovative designs of surface and
sub-surface drainage systems, which is the most
important component of landslide stabilisation
measures.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the DST; IITs,
universities, and other academic institutions.]
10.2.4 Instrumentation for Geotechnical
Investigation
In the context of scientific research,
geotechnical instrumentation is primarily needed
Research and Development
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
90
to unfold the mechanism of a landslide, collect
evidence and data for reliable slope analysis
and engineering, and remove uncertainties by
validating assumptions and checking the efficacy
of control works.
10.2.5 Development of Early Warning Systems
There are many major landslides located
either along busy road corridors or close to thickly
populated townships/important civil engineering
structures that require a huge amount of treatment
cost.
Such landslides will be selected for early
warning through a consultative mechanism in
association with state governments and local
bodies. The development of appropriate early
warning systems may be undertaken for such
identified landslides. Knowledge based institutes/
organisations with expertise and experience in
this area will be encouraged to take the lead. The
development of early warning systems by real-time
monitoring of some selected landslides may be
undertaken with a view to firming up both the early
warning technology and early warning thresholds.
Correspondence between rainfall thresholds and
landsliding will be developed for selected areas
based on in-depth scientific studies.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the DST; state
governments/SDMAs; district administrations;
IITs, universities, and other academic institutions.]
10.2.6 Landslide Dams
Dams generated by landslides are mainly
reported in the narrow valleys of the Himalayan
mountainous terrain. These may cause devastation
by flash floods due to sudden breaching. Except
for some preliminary investigation of a limited
number of such dams, systematic geotechnical
investigation has not so far been attempted.
Besides, there is no established mechanism by
which the incidence of such dams can be reported
to the appropriate authorities immediately
after their formation. As a result, preliminary
investigation cannot be taken up immediately after
their formation.
A mechanism must be developed by which
the information regarding the formation of a
landslide dam may be communicated to the
relevant authorities in the shortest possible time.
It is proposed that the NRSC be entrusted with
this task.
[Action: The NRSC.]
The following aspects of landslide dams can
be taken up for R&D:
i) Dam break analysis.
ii) Methodologies for providing controlled
outlets for dewatering the created reservoir.
iii) Procedure of risk assessment.
iv) Procedure for identification of potential
sites of formation of landslide dams and
monitoring techniques.
10.2.7 Run-Out and Return Period Modelling
of Landslides
This is one of the most important fields of
landslide studies where extensive R&D is required.
The basic requirements for the development of
run-out and return period modelling of landslides
is to map the landslides, identify the causes
and mechanism of failure, establish correlation
between triggering agents and the initiation of
slope failure, determine shear strength parameters
of the slope forming material, assess the hazards,
vulnerability, and elements at risk, etc. In some
countries like Italy, New Zealand, and the USA,
this type of modelling is done for individual slides
91
Whereas the whole range of issues connected
with climate change, including policies and
operation strategies, are beyond the scope of this
document, the unfolding consequences of climate
change, insofar as mitigation of landslide hazards
are concerned, deserve urgent attention. Rich
global experience, especially in understanding
and managing uncertain weather patterns and
landsliding, glacial lake outbursts, landslide dam
bursts and community-centric risk reduction
measures for human safety, should help speed
up our own programmes with innovation and
added emphasis on landslide hazard mitigation,
early warning and quick response to disasters and
long-term socio-economic risk reduction.
Research programmes to study this aspect
will be encouraged.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the DST; IMD;
IITs, universities, and other academic institutions.]
10.3 Important R&D Activities
R&D areas of importance are listed below.
This list is only suggestive and will be reviewed
from time to time in the backdrop of emerging
national priorities.
i) The refinement of methodologies for
carrying out LHZ mapping both at the
macro and meso scale, in order to give a
realistic picture of the hazard.
ii) Systematic scientific methods of landslide
hazard vulnerability assessment and risk
evaluation on the GIS platform.
iii) The integration of landslide hazards
into user-friendly multi-hazard mapping.
Projection of multi-hazard risk scenarios.
iv) The revisiting of past major landslide
disasters for scientific post-mortems and
documentation of the lessons learnt.
Research and Development
as it cannot be successfully done for a vast area
affected by numerous landslides in the absence of
a reliable historical landslide inventory database.
Since expertise in this area is not available within
the country, an R&D programme will be taken up
in collaboration with international institutes having
expertise in this field like the ITC, The Netherlands.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with IITs, universities,
and other academic institutions.]
10.2.8 Snow Avalanches
Simulation, snow cover modelling, avalanche
forecasting, snow cover parameter monitoring
using optical imagery and microwave data, and the
development of virtual reality based snow cover
variability visualisation are some of the fields of
active research. R&D on these and other related
fields will be promoted.
The SASE, in collaboration with knowledge
institutions and the NDMA, will visualise, design,
and implement R&D programmes for snow
avalanche studies.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with the
TAC and in collaboration with the SASE; IMD; DST;
IITs, universities, and other academic institutions.]
10.2.9 Emerging Concerns
Global warming and climate change are the
most critical areas of concern that can have
significant consequences on natural hazards
including landslides and snow avalanches.
The fragile mountain systems in India, where
most of the landslides occur, are exposed to
increasing risks due to climate change. In the
coming decades, the negative impact of climate
change will be exacerbated if mounting humaninduced pressures and unplanned urbanisation
grows unchecked.

v) The application of recent technological
d e v e l o p m e n t s i n t h e f i e l d s o f
instrumentation, remote sensing, software
and communication technologies for
landslide studies.
vi) The development of simple, quick, and
effective methodologies for assessing
direct as well as indirect losses due to the
occurrence of landslides.
vii) The quantification of environmental
degradation, anthropogenic impact, cost
of loss of land, agricultural produce,
livelihood, and traffic delays.
viii) The establishment of best practice
examples of deterministic and probabilistic
modelling methodologies for conducting
detailed stability analysis of complex
natural and man-made slopes and active
landslides.
ix) The scientific design of surface and subsurface drainage systems, technology for
their speedy installation, and evaluation of
their efficacy.
x) The development of innovative techniques
of landslide control, especially the
mechanised construction of complex
sub-surface drainage networks.
xi) The development of light rugged
geotechnical investigational equipment
suitable for rugged and inaccessible areas.
xii) The development of cheap and reliable
instrumentation techniques for slope
monitoring and installation of early warning
systems.
xiii) The systematisation of search and rescue
operations, and the development of
effective equipment for the same.
xiv) The development of simple and easy to
install instrumentation and slope monitoring
equipment for real-time early warning,
including early warning thresholds and criteria.
xv) The development of a predictive
understanding of landslide processes and
triggering mechanisms.
xvi) Regional real-time landslide warning
systems based on threshold values
of rainfall; real-time monitoring and
establishment of early warning systems
in the case of landslides that pose a
substantial risk to developmental gains.
xvii) The development of methodologies for
assessing potential co-seismic landslides.
xviii) Fundamental mechanisms of earthquakeinduced and earthquake-triggered
landslides.
xix) Remediation practices based on multidisciplinary field investigations suitable for
local conditions.
xx) Methodology for the identification of
potential sites of landslide dams.
xxi) Fashioning of landslide rescue operations
according to their typology.
xxii) Reservoir induced landslides, coastal
landslides, submarine slumping, and
tsunami related landslides.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with the
TAC and in collaboration with the MoM-GSI; DST;
CBRI, CRRI, CDMM; BRO; NRSC; IMD; CWC;
state governments; IITs, universities, and other
academic institutions.]
Besides, post-disaster scenario analysis
and simulation modelling are extremely useful
for undertaking long-term disaster management
programmes and for strengthening preparedness,
mitigation, and response efforts against landslide
hazards. Risk assessment and scenario projections
require data for all the landslide prone areas and
major landslides located in different environs in
different parts of the country, affecting existing
human habitations, environment, infrastructure,
and economic activities.
93
The NDMA, with the support of the nodal
agency, the GSI, will encourage the development
of standardised methodologies for landslide risk
assessment and scenario development. It will
also support studies to collect data and required
knowledge, develop state-of-the-art literature
and reports, select topics and evolve a procedure
for undertaking pilot projects related to detailed
investigations for stabilising major hazardous
landslides, and the development of early warning
systems.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation with the
TAC and in collaboration with the MoM-GSI; DST;
NIDM; BIS; IITs, universities, and other academic
institutions.]
The quantification of the landslide risk for
a specified area requires detailed information
on a number of factors, namely, topography,
geomorphology, geology, climatic conditions,
land use practices, land cover patterns, and
characteristics of surface slope forming material.
The reliability of landslide hazard maps will
depend on the accuracy of the base maps and the
approach followed in their GIS based integration
and subsequent validation. Freshly occurring
landslides and the reactivation of existing and
old landslides on account of earthquakes will
be studied. LHZ maps will be prepared based
on advanced research studies carried out by
knowledge institutions, to include earthquake
induced landslides in areas with high seismic risk.
Studies will be undertaken to evolve
procedures so that investigations, maps and
drawings of landslides in different geographical
regions of the country are easily available to users
in a form that can be easily comprehended.
There is an urgent need to develop mechanisms
to transfer the results of R&D efforts to the public
domain so that these can be utilised by scientists/
technologists engaged in LHM operations.
The success of all these efforts will depend on
the prior presence of a system with streamlined
procedures for the speedy funding of priority/fast
track projects. The mechanism for the evaluation
of project proposals, periodic reviews, and final
reviews will be an integral part of the system.
10.4 Areas Requiring Special Attention
There are many issues in landslide disaster
management, which are detailed in this document
at various places and require special attention
from planners and implementing agencies. The
gap issues have been identified and these will be
bridged in the near future in a planned manner.
These issues include:
i) The effective management of landslide
disasters in India would require detailed
studies using state-of-the-art technologies,
which is not practiced at present, and
needs to be encouraged.
ii) The practice of real-time monitoring
of potentially threatening landslides is
required to avert disasters by early warning.
This is currently absent in India.
iii) In current landslide disaster management
practice, the investigating and implementing
agencies are generally different. This
results in fragmented accountability and
communication gaps. Therefore, it will
be ensured that the recommendations of
the investigating agency will be carried
out by the implementing agency in close
association or consultation with the former.
iv) Partial implementation of stability measures
are understandably ineffective, and this
results in the reoccurrence of landslides
in general. Every landslide management
project must ensure the full implementation
of treatment measures in a single working
season and take recourse to monitoring
their efficacy in the post-implementation
stage.
Research and Development
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
94
v) The process of data collection is required
to be systematised. Sharing of data among
institutions engaged in landslide studies,
landslide disaster management and
communities at large will be encouraged
through effective networking.
vi) The culture of the observational method of
design and construction will be promoted
to help engineers and builders effectively
deal with uncertainties. The method
helps in the modulation of designs based
on actual ground realities as the work
progresses.
vii) The culture of monitoring the efficacy of
control measures will be promoted to
enhance the confidence level in design and
add value to it if the situation so demands.
viii) Good guidelines are not available on
information and material for courses
and training. The GSI, NIDM and other
knowledge institutions will be encouraged
to bridge this gap.
ix) There is a lack of an extensive network
of rain gauges in country. Due to this it
is very difficult to attempt correlation
between rainfall and landslide activity.
Proper coordination with the IMD is needed
for installing a network of automatic
rain gauges at desired locations. In this
connection it is necessary that a pilot
project of 20 conspicuous landslides in
different regions of the country, preferably
located in proximity to important townships
or thickly populated localities, is taken
up initially for rain gauge installation, and
if possible, installation of at least two
piezometers. The results and lessons
learnt will be disseminated to all concerned
in three-four years. The installation of
automatic rain gauges required for this
has to be integrated with the proposed
programme of the IMD for installing
automatic rain gauges at pre-selected
locations in the country. The IMD will also
provide daily rainfall data from existing rain
gauges on a daily basis to the data centre
for landslides so that the same can be
utilised by agencies or individuals engaged
in such studies. The concerned institutions
will be identified.
x) Initially, five landslides will be identified
for detailed study. It is proposed that
organisations/institutions engaged in
landslide studies, government or private,
be identified/selected and given the
responsibility for this work in coordination
with the BRO and the respective state
governments.
xi) Material and human resources available in
the country will be identified so that studies
that are to be taken up in relevant fields
are properly planned and realistic capacity
building programmes designed.
xii) The gaps between the landslide
management systems being practiced
in India and those being followed
internationally will be identified and
attempts will be made by all agencies
engaged in landslide disaster management
in the country to bridge these gaps so that
the latest systems practiced elsewhere are
also followed in India.

11 Implementation of the
Guidelines—Preparation of
Landslide Management Plans
11.1 Plans
Comprehensive DM plans will be prepared
at the national, state and district levels. At the
national level, the DM plan will focus on various
aspects of DM including preparedness, mitigation
and response. These plans will clearly identify
the roles of key stakeholders for each disaster
level and also include assessments of their own
response capacities.
In accordance with the various disaster
specific guidelines laid down by the NDMA, the
NEC will prepare a National Disaster Management
Plan, incorporating the DM plans prepared by
the central ministries/departments and state
governments for landslide affected states and
districts.
This plan, to be approved by the NDMA, will
include various aspects of landslide management.
The main features to be included in the plan are:
i) Preparation of state and district level DM
plans with the aim of managing landslide
hazard.
ii) Revision of town planning bye-laws and
adoption of model land use bye-laws in
hilly areas.
iii) Wide dissemination of model land use
practices in hilly areas.
iv) Training of trainers in professional and
technical institutions.
v) Training of professionals like engineers
and geologists for landslide mapping,
investigation techniques, analysis, and
observational practices.
vi) Launching public awareness campaigns
on landslide hazard and risk reduction, and
sensitising all stakeholders on landslide
hazard mitigation.
vii) Establishing appropriate mechanisms for
compliance reviews of all land use bye-laws
in hilly areas.
viii) Preparing an inventory of existing landslides,
active or inactive, in India.
ix) Developing an inventory of the existing
built environment in areas around existing
landslides and in high hazard zones as per
the LHZ maps.
x) Assessing the status of risk and vulnerability
of the existing built environment.
xi) Preparation of DM plans by educational and
health institutes/organisations, government
offices, etc., and carrying out mock drills
for enhancing preparedness in vulnerable
areas.
xii) Strengthening the EOC network.
xiii) Streamlining the mobilisation of
communities, government agencies, the
corporate sector, and other stakeholders.
xiv) Preparing community and village level
DM plans, with specific reference to the
management of landslides.
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
96
xv) Developing simple and effective information
and warning dissemination systems that
can reach affected communities in far flung
areas clearly and in time.
xvi) Introducing landslide safety education in
schools, colleges and universities.
xvii) Strengthening landslide safety R&D in
professional technical institutions.
xviii) Preparing documentation on the lessons
learnt from previous landslide incidences,
and their wide dissemination.
xix) Preparing an action plan for upgrading
the capabilities of organisations and
institutions involved in landslide disaster
management studies with clear roadmaps
and milestones.
xx) Developing appropriate risk transfer
instruments by collaborating with insurance
companies and financial institutions.
xxi) Operationalising the SDRF battalions in the
states.
xxii) Enforcing and monitoring the compliance
of land use and town planning bye-laws,
and other safety regulations in landslide
prone hilly areas.
[Action: Central ministries in collaboration with the
NEC; state governments.]
The time lines proposed for the implementation
of various activities in the Guidelines are considered
both important and desirable, especially in
the case of those non-structural measures for
which no clearance is required from central or
other agencies. Precise schedules for structural
measures will, however, have to be evolved in the
landslide management plans that will be followed
at the central ministries/state levels, duly taking
into account the availability of financial, technical,
and managerial resources. In case of compelling
circumstances warranting a change, consultation
with the NDMA will be undertaken well in advance
for any adjustment, on a case to case basis.
11.2 Plans of Central Ministries and
Departments
The central ministries and departments
concerned will prepare their DM plans which will
be in accordance with the National Guidelines on
the preparation of state disaster management
plans and shall cover all aspects of the disaster
cycle for every disaster, including landslides.
These plans will clearly indicate the actions
to be taken, the allocation of tasks among the
various functionaries, the SOPs to be followed,
the methodology for carrying out the tasks
specified and the time lines for their execution.
Mock drills will be carried out to test the efficacy
of implementation of these plans by the agencies
falling within the purview of various ministries/
departments and other stakeholders at regular
intervals.
[Action: The MHA in collaboration with central
ministries; the MoM-GSI.]
DM plans will necessarily address worst
case scenarios and cover various aspects of
management like response, risk situation,
awareness, information, and communication.
Since some disasters may transcend geographic
boundaries, these plans will also recognise
the importance of effective networking and
coordination of different levels of the response
mechanisms.
The responsibilities for managing location
specific landslides often rests with the ministries
(Table 12.1) and departments of the central and
state governments, local authorities, public
sector undertakings, and the corporate sector.
Inter-ministerial coordination will go a long way in
97
Implementation of the Guidelines—Preparation of Landslide Management Plans
providing holistic perception and concerted effort
in mitigating landslide hazards.

11.3 Plans of State Governments
In addition to preparing their DM plans,
the state governments with areas affected by
landslides will also encourage the preparation
of community preparedness plans to address
their own special features, outline the linkages
of the various state support systems, and the
jurisdictions of each of these departments.
The GoI has initiated the GoI-UNDP
Programme on Disaster Risk Management
(DRM) to encourage the development of district,
block, taluka/tehsil, and village DM plans, which
will be further strengthened. The existing plans
will be modified, wherever required, in order to
streamline and optimise the response systems.
These DM plans will be widely disseminated
among various stakeholders for creating greater
public awareness. These plans must indicate
the responsible departments for carrying out
specific tasks along with time lines for their
implementation. It is required that the state
DGMs be made an integral part of these plans
as these are likely to play an important role in
the management of landslides as well as other
natural disasters.
[Action: State governments/SDMAs.]
Authorities in charge of educational institutions
will prepare landslide preparedness plans and
conduct mock drills in landslide affected areas. In
many cases frequent landsliding activity results in
travellers getting stranded. They may get exposed
to harsh weather due to the non-availability of
shelters at isolated locations. The plans should
therefore include the identification of such
locations for the construction and maintenance
of shelters, at least during the periods when
landslides occur frequently.
The DM plans will comply with the National
Guidelines on the preparation of state disaster
management plans and the guidelines of the
SDMA, if any, and incorporate all the features
of the EOCs including their establishment and
operation.
[Action: State governments/SDMAs.]
11.4 Disaster Management Plans of
the Nodal Agency
The responsibilities of the GSI as the nodal
agency include coordinating all activities related
to landslide hazard mitigation, monitoring the
occurrence of landslides anywhere in India with
the assistance of various departments of the
central and state governments, coordinating
and carrying out preliminary investigations of
these incidences, reporting the same to various
designated functionaries in the GoI and state
governments, and carrying out LHZ mapping and
other relevant studies.
The GSI will set up a secretariat at an
appropriate place for the purpose of coordinating
nationwide activities, carrying out landslide studies
in different fields related to landslides either
independently as departmental programmes or in
collaboration with other agencies in studies that
require multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional
inputs.
[Action: The MoM-GSI.]
The GSI maintains a primary node of the
Disaster Management Support (DMS) network
that provides continuous connectivity with states
vulnerable to natural disasters. This system would

help in the communication of disaster related
information on a real-time basis. The availability
of information on a real-time basis would also
help the GSI to send officers or coordinate with
geoscientists of the DGMs of landslide affected
states to carry out preliminary investigations of
landslides occurring in any part of the country on
an emergency basis and communicate reports to
the designated authorities. The GSI will develop
an effective information system in consultation
with states affected by landslide hazard so that
all information regarding landslide occurrence is
communicated to the DMS control room of the
GSI on a real-time basis so that necessary action
is initiated. The SOPs have already been developed
for this purpose by the MHA in consultation with
the department.
The GSI, along with the primary node of the
DMS network, will set up a data management
facility where all the data related to landslides,
including inventory will be stored and made
available to bona fide users.
[Action: The MoM-GSI.]
As the nodal agency for landslide
management, the MoM-GSI will prepare its
Landslide Management Plan (LMP) based on the
guidelines laid down by the NDMA.
The various aspects of the LMP prepared
by other central ministries/departments, state
governments and other stakeholder groups will
be considered in the LMP prepared by the GSI.
The GSI, in consultation with the NDMA, will also
prepare a comprehensive plan for the upgradation
of the capabilities of the department with a clear
roadmap and milestones.
[Action: The MoM-GSI.]
The GSI, as the nodal agency for landslides in
the country, will be assisted by all the concerned
agencies involved in landslide management.
11.5 Implementation of Landslide
Management Plans
11.5.1 Institutional Mechanisms
The development and implementation of
disaster plans will be a coordinated programme
of the NDMA, GSI as the nodal agency, and the
national, state, district, and local administrations.
The capacity and potential of other government
organisations, knowledge institutions and
academic institutions will be harnessed and
incorporated into the national landslide hazard
mitigation endeavour.

a disaster threat or actual disaster it will coordinate
the response and perform such functions as may
be required by the NDMA.
[Action: NDRF in collaboration with the GSI; BRO.]
The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)
mandated by the DM Act, 2005, will address,
in close collaboration with all other field level
agencies, all concerns regarding the response to
the threat of landslide disaster or other disasters
if and when these arise or occur.
[Action: NDRF.]
The general superintendency, direction
and control of this force shall be vested in and
exercised by the NDMA and the command and
supervision of the force shall vest in an officer to
be appointed by the Central Government as the
Director General of the NDRF.
The NDRF personnel will be equipped with the
most modern search and rescue equipment and
will undergo landslide specific training to be able
to effectively deal with diverse types of landslides
and other mass movements and familiarise
themselves with the case records of some of the
major landslide events.
[Action: The NEC in collaboration with the NDRF.]
The role of the GSI, the nodal agency in the
management of landslide hazards, will be to
maintain a liaison with the NDMA, MHA, central
and state government agencies and to coordinate
and facilitate landslide DM programmes through
the NDMA. Besides, the GSI will continue
with landslide investigations in various states
and union territories under its annual field
season programmes, keeping in mind the overall
framework of these Guidelines.
The BRO, DTRL, SASE, GSI, and other
institutions dealing with landslides and other mass
movements will suitably improve their capacity
to meet present as well as future challenges in
the landslide sector, including the modernisation
of investigation and mapping methodologies,
and application of satellite, information, and
communications technologies.
[Action: The BRO; DTRL; MoM-GSI; SASE; CBRI;
CRRI; CDMM; NRSC; ISRO; Department of
Information Technology.]
In case a major landslide disaster occurs, the
DM departments/commissioners in the states
concerned will deal with the rescue and relief
operations.
[Action: State governments in collaboration with
the district administrations.]
The state governments will establish SDMAs,
headed by the respective chief minister in landslide
affected states to lay down policies and plans for
DM in the state. The SDMA will approve the state
plan in accordance with the guidelines laid down
by the NDMA, coordinate the implementation of
the state plan, recommend the provision of funds
for mitigation and preparedness measures and
review the developmental plans of the different
departments of the state to ensure the integration
of prevention, awareness, preparedness, and
mitigation measures.
[Action: State governments/SDMAs.]
The state governments will constitute State
Executive Committees (SECs) to assist the SDMA
in performing its functions. The SEC will be headed
by the chief secretary to the state government and
will coordinate and monitor the implementation of
the national policy, the national plan, and the state
plan. It will also provide information to the NDMA
relating to different aspects of DM.
At the district level, the District Disaster
Management Authority (DDMA) headed by the
district magistrate, with the elected representative
101
of the local authority as the co-chairperson, will act
as the planning, coordinating and implementing
body for DM and take all necessary measures for
the purposes of DM in the district in accordance
with the guidelines laid down by the NDMA and
SDMA.
DDMAs will prepare the district DM plans
including the response plan for the district, and
will coordinate and monitor the implementation
of the national policy, state policy, national
plan, state plan, and district plan and ensure
that the guidelines for prevention, mitigation,
preparedness, and response measures laid
down by the NDMA and SDMA are followed by
all departments of the government at the district
level and also by the local authorities in the district.
[Action: The DDMAs.]
Local bodies include PRIs and ULBs such as
municipal corporations, municipalities, district and
cantonment boards, and town planning authorities
responsible for the control and management of
civic services.
These bodies will ensure DM capacity building
of their officers and employees, carry out relief,
rehabilitation and reconstruction activities in the
affected areas, and will prepare DM plans in
consonance with the guidelines of the NDMA,
SDMAs and DDMAs.
[Action: State governments in collaboration with
district administrations; local bodies.]
The planned building of multi-disciplinary
teams, especially in landslide prone areas and
their effective networking and empowerment will
substantially add to the national effort in achieving
a paradigm shift from a relief-centric approach to
landslide prevention, mitigation and management.
Special attention will be paid to the modernisation
of investigation and mapping methodologies,
and application of satellite, information and
communications technologies.
11.5.2 Centre for Landslide Research, Studies
and Management
A national level Centre for Landslide Research
Studies and Management (CLRSM) will be
established by the MoM as a premier geo-hazard
institute with state-of-the art facilities, which
would eventually grow into a national centre
of excellence. It will be fully autonomous in its
functioning, similar to that of a national laboratory
of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research
with full operational freedom and an independent
budget. It will operate within a framework of
specified rules. The CLRSM will be headed by an
eminent landslide expert with a proven track record.
This initiative will help in ensuring a wider view
of landslides as a component of the environment
and bringing the existing pool of expertise in earth
sciences, including coastal stability, seismology,
and meteorology, to bear upon this new initiative.
The national centre will be serviced by a
nation-wide chain of actual as well as virtual
sub-centres (field offices) to ensure adequate
national coverage, information flow, community
participation, networking, and feedback. It will also
foster, promote and sustain a scientific culture in
the management of slopes and landslides aiming
for a paradigm shift in the culture of safety. It will
aim to galvanise the existing scattered pool of
scientific and technological expertise, especially
in subjects such as earth sciences, meteorology,
coastal protection, seismology, space research,
information and communications technology,
and urban development. Other areas of concern
to be addressed by the centre will be to learn
lessons from past landslides, and arranging for
high quality education, research, training, and
documentation. To begin with, sub-centres (field
offices) will, as far as possible, be located in one of
Implementation of the Guidelines—Preparation of Landslide Management Plans

the existing knowledge institutions to be identified
in consultation with the state government. The
network could be gradually expanded in tune with
the dynamics of felt needs. The establishment of
virtual sub-centres will be encouraged to serve
as clearing houses of information. The national
capacity building initiative of the central and state
governments would make adequate funding
provisions to ensure a critical mass of staffing and
infrastructure in the field offices. The CLRSM will
nurture the field offices, eventually making them
financially self-supporting within the time frame
of one decade.
In the field of geotechnical investigation
and research, the CLRSM will coordinate and
collaborate with the National Geotechnical Facility
(NGF) being established by the DST at Dehradun,
and with the Indian Geotechnical Society.
[Action: The MoM.]
A high level scientific and Technical Advisory
Committee (TAC) which will be chaired by the
Secretary, MoM, will be constituted by the MoM
in consultation with the NDMA to serve as a think
tank to nurse the landslide sector with cutting
edge science and technology, fresh ideas and
stimulus.
It will also make recommendations to the GoI
on various aspects of the CLRSM, including its
formation, location, aims and objects, funding,
functioning, and autonomy.
[Action: The MoM.]
The TAC will comprise top professionals drawn
from multi-speciality streams connected with
landslide mitigation and management, and it will
address research, human resource and capacity
development, landslide mapping, investigation,
mitigation, and the control, preservation, and
protection of slopes as a component of the
environment.
It will also provide full support to the human
resource development and training functions
delegated to the NIDM.
[Action: The MoM in collaboration with the MoES.]
The Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences,
Director General, GSI, Secretary, DST and
Executive Director of the NIDM will be ex-officio
members of both CLRSM and TAC.
[Action: MoM in collaboration with the MoES;
GSI; DST; NIDM.]
Effective management of landslide disasters
requires the integration and translation of landslide
concerns into developmental planning. Some of
the issues that need serious consideration are
listed in table 11.2 on the next page.
11.5.3 Implementation and Monitoring
The LMPs prepared by the central ministries,
departments concerned, state governments,
district authorities, rural bodies, urban local
bodies, and other stakeholders in accordance with
these Guidelines will be implemented by them in
accordance with in-built schedules.
These plans will indicate clearly the structure
of the monitoring system and the reports to be
generated at various levels together with the
agency to which the report is to be sent, its format
and the frequency/timing.

ii) Empowerment of multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary teams.
iii) Switch-over from piecemeal remediation of landslides to a holistic implementation of control
measures.
iv) Discard outmoded approaches in landslide remediation and switch-over to state-of-the-art
technology based landslide control.
v) Mobilisation and participation of the private sector and insurance sector.
vi) Streamlining procedures for speedy funding of priority/fast track projects.
vii) Switch-over from conventional bureaucratic benchmarking and project progress evaluation
to peer-centric progress review, evaluation and mid-course correction.
viii) Seeding the concept of landslide prevention and opportunity costs in the administrative
management of landslides.
11.6 Financial Arrangements for
Landslide Management
11.6.1 Mainstreaming of Disaster Management
in Developmental Plans
The central and state ministries/departments
will mainstream disaster management efforts in
their developmental plans.
In the annual expenditure plans, specific
allocations will be made for carrying out disaster
awareness programmes, maintaining preparedness
and for undertaking mitigation efforts. Wherever
necessary and feasible, the corporate sector
should also be involved in supporting landslide risk
management efforts as part of CSR.
[Action: Central ministries in collaboration with
state governments; NDMA.]
11.6.2 Plans of Central Ministries/Departments
A working group on DM, constituted for
the first time by the Planning Commission, has
made several recommendations in this regard,
the incorporation of which in the Eleventh FiveYear Plan will significantly facilitate the funding of
plans (as well as mitigation projects) made on the
basis of these guidelines by the central ministries/
departments and state governments.
The various measures for landslide
management recommended in the Guidelines will
be funded by the central ministries/departments
and state governments concerned by making
provisions in their Five-Year and annual plans.
Additional funds will also be made available through
special mitigation projects to be formulated and
implemented by the state governments/SDMAs
under the overall guidance and supervision of
the NDMA. Besides this, 10 per cent of the
Calamity Relief Fund (CRF) could also be utilised
for the purchase of equipment for landslide
preparedness and mitigation, and for rescue and
relief operations.
[Action: SDMAs in collaboration with central
ministries.]

11.6.3 State Plans
Landslide management schemes would be
planned, funded, executed, and maintained by the
state governments themselves as per their own
priorities. Central plan assistance would be in the
form of block loans and grants and would not be tied
to any sector or project. Allocations for the landslide
sector within the overall plan outlay would have to
be made by the state governments themselves.
The various measures for landslide management
recommended in these Guidelines will be included by
the respective state governments in their own plans.
[Action: State governments.]
11.6.4 Centrally Sponsored/Central Sector
Schemes
The role of the central government is advisory,
promotional and facilitative in nature. Even though
the MoM/GSI, DST, NRSC, and other organisations
do undertake landslide hazard assessment and
other landslide management related activities,
the overall allocation for these schemes is far too
little to have an impact on landslide management
in India.
On specific requests from the state
governments, the MoM/GSI will include some
of the schemes recommended in the Guidelines
for funding under these schemes, provided that
sufficient funds are available.
[Action: The MoM-GSI.]
11.6.5 District Planning and Development
Council Funds
From the funds available with the District
Planning and Development Council in landslide prone
areas, a part will be allocated for the implementation
of landslide management schemes in the districts.
[Action: SDMAs.]
11.6.6 National Landslide Mitigation Project
The NDMA has proposed to take up a National
Landslide Mitigation Project in the Eleventh FiveYear plan whose aims and objectives will be
developed and finalised in due course. In a broader
sense, it will consider the following issues:
i) Assessment of the risk and vulnerabilities
associated with landslide disasters.
ii) Reduction in the degree of risk, severity
or consequences of landslides, and their
mitigation.
iii) Setting pace setter examples for geological
and geotechnical investigations of
landslides and also for efficacy of landslide
treatment measures.
iv) Establishment of monitoring and early
warning systems for a few selected
landslides.
v) Capacity development of institutes/
organisations enhancing the capabilities of
communities and training of functionaries.
vi) Identification of institutes/organisations and
entrusting them with the implementation
of R&D programmes.
vii) Enhancing the promptness and efficacy
of response to impending threats of
landslides, or their actual occurrence.
viii) Ensuring that proper arrangements are
made for organising rescue, relief and
rehabilitation works.
ix) Improving the quality and increasing the
speed of rehabilitation and reconstruction
processes.
x) Spreading awareness with a stress on
preparedness, and providing advice and
training to the agencies involved in the
management of landslides.

12 Summary of Action Points
Chapter 1: The Context
Landslides are a significant natural hazard
for India. They not only threaten the
environment, human safety, infrastructure,
and post-earthquake relief operations but
also have a huge impact on the national
economy. They deserve much greater
attention in terms of multi-hazard mapping,
research, scientific investigations, and
effective mitigation and management
practices. The Guidelines address all the
varied aspects of landslide mitigation and
management and adopt a holistic and
integrated approach that maximises the
networking of voluntary agencies, affected
communities and other stakeholders.
 1) Avalanche Control Strategies
The SASE and BRO will be responsible
for the identification and monitoring
of snow avalanches. The SASE will be
responsible for the zonation of avalanche
prone areas and the forecasting of snow
avalanches. Central and state governments
in association with the BRO will be
responsible for implementing clearance
and control strategies against identified
snow avalanches. [Action: The nodal
ministry in consultation with the TAC and in
collaboration with the SASE, BRO, central
government, and state governments]
(Section 1.7.6).
2) Search and Rescue Operations
The SASE is presently not involved in
carrying out search and rescue operations.
Therefore, the district administration will
identify organisations/institutions that
can take up programmes to educate the
communities living in avalanche prone
areas, to prepare them with the latest
techniques of self-survival, and to equip
them with simple and essential tools.
Similarly, the organisations engaged in
development and strategic tasks at high
altitudes will be educated on initial search
and rescue operations and the use of
basic equipment necessary for these
operations.QRTs equipped with the latest
rescue equipment like snow clearing tools,
probes, communication capability, and
medical emergency aids will be organised.
These teams will have the capability to be
mobilised at very short notice and reach
the affected sites within the shortest
possible time. The QRTs shall include
trained personnel drawn from different
arms of the local administration and the
NDRF. [Action: SDMAs in collaboration with
DDMAs, NDRF] (Section 1.7.7).
Chapter 2: Hazard Zonation Mapping
3) Landslide Inventory
The preparation of a comprehensive and
user-friendly national landslide inventory
database will be taken up, paving the way
for continuous updating of the landslide
map of India. This will be achieved by a
nation-wide networking of the agencies
engaged in the task and would be aided
National Disaster Management Guidelines: Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches
106
by the latest geomatic tools, followed by
field checks. [Action: The MoM-GSI in
collaboration with state DGMs; WIHG;
NIDM; NRSC; SRSCs; BRO] (Section 2.2).
4) LHZ Mapping
i) Landslide studies are being carried
out at a scale of up to 1:5,000 and
at even larger scales for detailed
studies, depending on the size of the
landslide and other requirements. A
nation-wide consensus on selection
of mapping scales will be reached
with a view to introducing rational
uniform procedures throughout the
country. [Action: The nodal ministry
in consultation with the TAC and
in collaboration with the NRSC;
BIS; DST; CBRI; CRRI; WIHG; IITs,
universities, and other academic
institutions] (Section 2.3.1).
ii) Approaches to landslide hazard
mapping being used by different
agencies in India are at variance with
each other. The ongoing mapping
programmes should continue to make
the best use of the prevailing state-ofthe-art technologies, at the same time
making a determined effort to arrive
at national level recommendations
through a process of workshops and
rigorous peer review. [Action: The
nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the
NRSC; BIS; DST; CBRI; CRRI; WIHG;
IITs, universities, and other academic
institutions] (Section 2.3.3).
iii) The BIS will critically review and revise
its guidelines on LHZ mapping, taking
full advantage of the experiences of
the GSI and other agencies in this
field. This will be achieved within
the next two years. Subsequently,
these will be revised every five years.
[Action: The BIS in collaboration with
the GSI; IITs, universities, and other
academic institutions] (Section 2.3.3).
iv) The most important inputs required
for carrying LHZ mapping at both
the macro and meso scale are
topographical and geological maps,
remote sensing products, and
seismological data in the case of
seismogenic landslides. Repositories
of these are the SoI, GSI, NRSC, and
IMD. These agencies will be made
an integral part of any effort in this
direction so that the work does not
suffer for want of these vital inputs,
and additional demands can also
be serviced. The IMD and CWC
will have to increase the network
density of rain gauge stations (with
particular reference to major landslide
susceptibility locations) and seismic
observatories in hilly regions. The
SoI should also take up the task of
generating topographic/contour maps
at the scale of 1:5,000 or 1:10,000 for
the landslide affected hilly regions
of India. A mechanism will be put in
place so that the seismic and rainfall
data are communicated to the national
landslide hazard database centre on
a real-time basis. [Action: The SoI in
collaboration with the IMD; MoM-GSI;
NRSC; CWC] (Section 2.3.4).
5) Seismic Landslide Hazard Zonation
Comprehensive research, development
and field-oriented studies on problematic
slopes with the help of instruments
should be undertaken to improve our
understanding of earthquake induced
landslides. Multi-hazard and seismic
micro-zonation programmes would be
107
enriched by an added focus on the hitherto
neglected subject of earthquake-induced
landslides in hilly areas and their effects
on slope instability. [Action: The nodal
ministry in consultation with the TAC
and in collaboration with the IMD; DST;
CDMM; WIHG; IITs, universities, and other
academic institutions] (Section 2.3.5).
6) Prioritisation of Areas for LHZ Mapping
i) The identified areas for macro scale
LHZ mapping are proposed to be
completed during the first phase by
2013. The mapping will be done by
various institutions, of which a major
portion will be done by the GSI. It is
proposed that in the second phase,
the macro scale LHZ mapping may be
taken up district- or basin-wise in the
Lesser and Outer Himalayas, the NER
and the Nilgiris in the areas not covered
in the first phase. Subsequently, the
LHZ mapping can be extended to
difficult areas in the Higher Himalayas
and the interior areas of the NER.
Depending upon the availability of
resources, the second phase will
extend up to 2020 or beyond. The
national priorities will be reviewed and
mapping methodologies improved as
the work progresses. [Action: SDMAs/
state governments in collaboration
with the TAC; MoM-GSI; NRSC; DST;
BRO; WIHG; PRIs; CRRI] (Section
2.3.6).
ii) The locations requiring studies at
the meso scale shall be identified in
consultation with state governments
and other agencies, prioritised
and taken up for LHZ mapping in a
phased manner, depending upon
the availability of resources. In the
second phase of LHZ mapping at the
meso scale, the areas not covered
during the first phase will be taken
up. The work carried out in this phase
will extend up to 2020 or beyond,
depending on the resources available.
[Action: SDMAs/state governments in
collaboration with the TAC; MoM-GSI;
NRSC; DST; BRO; WIHG; PRIs; CRRI]
(Section 2.3.6).
iii) Considering the importance of
landslide risk zonation mapping, a
proposal has been recently drawn
up by the BIS to frame guidelines for
landslide risk zonation mapping, and
the GSI along with some members
of the sectional committee on the
Hill Development Council of the BIS
have been requested to prepare the
draft guidelines. [Action: The BIS
in collaboration with the MoM-GSI]
(Section 2.4.1).
Chapter 3: Geological and Geotechnical
Investigations
7) Geological Investigations
The preliminary and detailed geological
investigation of landslides constitutes the
foundation on which sound geotechnical
investigation must be built. Detailed
guidelines will be developed for ensuring
systematic geological investigation and
mapping. [Action: The BIS in collaboration
with the MoM-GSI; DST; IITs, universities
and other academic institutions] (Section

8) Geotechnical Investigation
i) Guidelines will be developed to usher
in the culture of sound geotechnical
investigation suited to different
geological settings and anthropogenic
situations. Systematic scientific
geotechnical investigation will

become an essential component of
any important landslide management
initiative. The training of professionals,
writing of field manuals, and
introduction of appropriate tools
and techniques for investigation will
be accorded priority. The guidelines
will emphasise the importance of
fashioning geotechnical investigations
on hard field evidence and the previous
history of the slope. The importance
of arriving at critical slope profiles,
elucidation of the possible modes of
failure, and purpose oriented field and
laboratory testing and instrumentation
for the validation of design assumptions
will be highlighted to improve
the health of current engineering
practices. Engineering geologists
and geotechnical engineers will be
jointly trained to raise the standards
of investigation and data analysis. All
major landslide remediation works will
be linked intimately with the findings
of geotechnical reports. [Action: The
BIS in collaboration with the NIDM;
DST; CDMM; MoM-GSI; CBRI; CRRI;
WIHG; CoA; IITs, universities and other
academic institutions] (Section 3.3)
ii) The private sector can play a major
role in improving the national capacity
for quality geotechnical investigations
and will be encouraged to do so
through professional bodies like the
Indian Geotechnical Society (IGS).
[Action: The DST in collaboration with
the TAC; IGS; engineering project
authorities] (Section 3.3).
iii) There is a need to develop guidelines
for scientific analysis of slopes and
landslides in terms of total and
effective stress, as the ground situation
demands. Every report will specifically
point out the assumptions made and
the limitations of the data used in slope
analysis and design. [Action: The BIS
in collaboration with the CDMM; CoA;
IITs, universities and other academic
institutions] (Section 3.3).
iv) Geotechnical investigations for such
a set of problems fall in a specialised
domain and must be critically
examined by investigators. [Action:
The nodal ministry in consultation with
the TAC and in collaboration with the
IMD; DST; CDMM; IITs, universities
and other academic institutions]
(Section 3.3).
9) Culture of the Observational Method of
Design and Construction
There is an urgent need to sensitise
professionals on how to handle slope
failures and their remediation, as well as
landslide emergencies and uncertainties by
making efficient use of the observational
method and the power of engineering
judgment. The culture of the observational
method of design and construction will be
promoted with training on the development
of contingency plans. [Action: The NIDM
in collaboration with the CDMM; CoA;
IITs, universities and other academic
institutions] (Section 3.3.1).
10) Pilot Projects for the Investigation of Major
Landslides
A few major landslides will be identified
for creating pace setter practical examples
of systematic and scientific geotechnical
investigations which will include detailed
geological and geotechnical mapping
at the scale of 1:500 or 1:1,000. The
identification and investigation will be
done by assigning tasks to organisations
or institutions identified as having multidisciplinary expertise and experience.
These organisations will not only aid in the
development of a systematic method but
also assist in the development of standard
codes, and planning for capacity building for
109
geological and geotechnical investigations.
[Action: The nodal ministry in consultation
with the TAC and in collaboration with the
MoM-GSI; BRO; CBRI; CRRI; DST; CDMM;
WIHG; BIS; IITs, universities and other
academic institutions] (Section 3.5).
Chapter 4: Landslide Risk Treatment
11) Landmass Improvement Techniques
Identified hazardous landslides will be
prioritised and treatment measures
implemented after detailed investigations.
The implementation measures will be
supervised by trained representatives
of investigating teams and monitored
for their efficacy. [Action: The nodal
ministry in consultation with the TAC and
in collaboration with the MoM-GSI; BRO;
CBRI; CRRI; DST; CDMM; IITs, universities
and other academic institutions] (Section
4.2.1).
12) Mitigation Measures for Landslide Dams
i) In case a report of landslide dam
formation after heavy rainfall/strong
earthquake/rapid snowmelt in hilly
areas is received, the vulnerable areas
will be reconnoitred immediately, if
required by helicopter, to see whether
more such landslide dams have
been formed or not. For inaccessible
areas and trans-boundary rivers, the
vulnerable areas will be monitored
by the NRSC through satellites
on a real-time basis. If such an
occurrence is noticed, the situation
will be monitored continuously and
information about the developments
will be communicated immediately
to the designated authorities such as
the MHA, NDMA and the concerned
SDMAs. [Action: The CWC in
collaboration with the NRSC; MHA;
SDMAs; BRO; IMD] (Section 4.4).
ii) The SDMAs will establish and activate
the warning and communications
systems immediately so that
information reaches the last post on
a real-time basis and proper action is
taken by all players involved in an effort
to save lives and minimise the loss to
property and infrastructural elements.
[Action: The SDMAs in collaboration
with the BRO] (Section 4.4).
iii) A team of experts will reach the
affected site as soon as possible to
monitor the situation, assess the
stability status of the structure and
landslide activity, and changes in
water level in the impounded lake. The
teams will implement the required
initial measures to the extent possible
immediately. [Action: The CWC in
collaboration with the MoM-GSI;
BRO] (Section 4.4).
iv) Monitoring the stability status of the
landslide dam, even if it is apparently
found to be stabilised, and the water
level behaviour, will be continued for
longer periods. [Action: The CWC]
(Section 4.4).
v) For assessing the flood hazard posed
by the dam in the event of its breaching
by a landslide, Dam Break Analysis
will be conducted for identifying
vulnerable areas. Communities living
in such areas will be kept in a state
of alert as long as the threat of flash
floods exists. [Action: The CWC in
collaboration with the SDMAs; District
Administration] (Section 4.4).
vi) The lead for these assessment and
mitigation efforts will be taken by the
CWC/MoWR in collaboration with the
GSI, NRSC and the respective state
governments. [Action: The CWC in
collaboration with the MoM-GSI;
NRSC; SDMAs] (Section 4.4).
